- Also pushed the previously-uncommitted `testbranch2` work to the remote (fast-forward `d89aa5fc..59663e30`): the PDF preview removal + the `testbranch-pdf` merge, combined with the collaborator's attendance update and the inventory system.

---

## August 31, 2026 03:53 AM (PHT) â€” aeprnts (collaborator)
- `feat: notifications & announcements system (priority tiers)`
- `feat: pricing management`
- `feat: payment methods + QR management`
- `feat: system-wide blue-white theme, pointer cursors, status-card redesign`
- `feat: staff management overhaul & Docufy rebrand`
- **Notifications/Announcements** â€” centralized `announcementsStore` + shared `NotificationsPage` (`/customer|/staff|/admin/notifications`): admin broadcasts announcements to All Users, per-user read tracking, **priority tiers (Regular / Important / Emergency)** with an **Important Announcements** section on top (red URGENT + amber IMPORTANT cards) and a clean **Notifications** section below; unread badge + amber attention dot in the sidebar (desktop + mobile). `type` field (announcement/pricing/maintenance/reminder/promo) is ready for future system-generated events.
- **Pricing Management** â€” `pricingStore` + `/admin/pricing`: shared pricing model (B&W / color tiers, paper-size surcharges, duplex savings, down-payment threshold) consumed live by print request, walk-in, invoice, landing, and order-tracking flows.
- **Payment Methods + QR** â€” `paymentMethodsStore` + `/admin/payment-methods` + shared `PaymentMethodQR`: admin-managed online payment methods used across verification and print requests (legacy hardcoded GCash pages left un-routed).

---

## August 31, 2026 04:30 AM (PHT) â€” prans
- `UI polish + maps + shop location` (commit `934702f8`), then **merged collaborator (aeprnts) `7d7f3761`** into `testbranch2` (merge commit `bd5c6c62`).
- **UI polish**: applied the light-blue-outline buttons (`border-2 border-blue-200`) with blue-fill-on-hover system-wide to non-destructive buttons; fixed white-on-white hover on Preview/View/status-toggle buttons.
- **Login page**: filled-blue "Log In" button + redesigned MFA "Verify" pill with press animation; "Back to Login" as a clean text-link with arrow.
- **Google Maps**: embedded a no-API-key Maps iframe in the landing page *Location* card behind a "Shop Location" button + mini window, and added a "Shop Location" button + map dialog to the customer dashboard (right of the welcome back message).
- **Merge**: resolved 5 conflicting files by keeping both feature sets (`LandingPage`, `ContentManagement`, `CustomerDashboard`, `JobBoard` hand-merged; `Staff.tsx` adopted the collaborator's authoritative rewrite). Build passes (2386 modules).

---

## August 31, 2026 04:55 AM (PHT) â€” prans
- Post-merge UI/UX session pushed directly to `testbranch2` (4 requests).
- **Task 1 â€” Live clock & date in Orders header**: `shared/UnifiedOrders.tsx` now shows a live PHT clock (updates every second) + full date (`weekday, month day, year`) under the page subtitle on the shared admin/staff Orders page.
- **Task 2 â€” Sidebar scroll preservation**: the mobile nav sheet (`shared/MobileNavSheet.tsx`) preserves the nav scroll position across open/close (the Radix sheet unmounts its content when closed; a `navRef` + saved `scrollTop` restores it on reopen). Desktop sidebar already persisted naturally.
- **Task 3 â€” Uniform buttons (Choose File reference)**: converted the remaining filled-blue primary CTAs in collaborator-added files (not covered by the earlier system-wide restyle) to the uniform white + light-blue-outline (`border-2 border-blue-200`, blue-fill-on-hover) style: `shared/NotificationsPage.tsx` (Create/Send Notification), `admin/Staff.tsx` (Add Staff / Create Staff Account / Save Changes), `admin/PricingManagement.tsx` (Save Changes), `admin/PaymentMethodsManagement.tsx` (Add Payment Method / Save). Kept AGENTS.md exclusions (destructive/red, amber warnings, green positive, status chips, nav, stateful Clock-In, and the reverted Place Order/Next Step CTAs).
- **Task 4 â€” Unified notifications (show both in each)**: made the bell dropdown AND the `/notifications` page show the SAME combined feed of admin announcements (`announcementsStore`) + order/payment/status system notifications (`notificationStore`). Bell dropdown (`Layout.tsx`) merges both kinds into one chronological list (announcements get priority-colored icons Megaphone/amber/red), and its unread badge now sums announcements + system notifications. The Notifications page adds a system-notification subscription, merges them into the "Notifications" section sorted newest-first with matching cards, and its unread count/mark-all-read covers both stores.
- Build passes (2386 modules).

---

## August 31, 2026 05:06 AM (PHT) â€” prans
- Follow-up polish pushed to `testbranch2` (3 requests).
- **SIEM security alerts removed**: deleted the admin Shield "Security Alerts" icon + its dropdown entirely from `Layout.tsx` (header) â€” state, presence, subscription, handlers, helpers, and the unused `Shield/MapPin/XCircle/Clock/Upload` icon imports all removed. Also deleted the now-orphaned `src/app/utils/siemAlertStore.ts` (no remaining imports anywhere). Build module count 2385.
- **Desktop sidebar scroll persistence**: the desktop sidebar `<nav>` in `Layout.tsx` now keeps its scroll position across navigation. Root cause: each page renders its own `<Layout>`, so Layout remounts on every route change and the sidebar jumped back to top. Fixed with a module-level `savedSidebarScrollTop` (survives remounts) + a `navRef`/`onScroll` on the `<nav>` and a mount-time restore. The sidebar now stays where the user left it until they scroll again. (The mobile sheet already had this from the prior push.)
- **Pricing hover text fix**: in `admin/PricingManagement.tsx`, "Reset to Defaults" (and the same-pattern per-row "Edit") buttons use `variant="outline"` whose base adds `hover:text-white` â€” combined with the light-blue `hover:bg-[#F2F7FF]` override it made the label white-on-light-blue (invisible). Added `hover:text-[#2F6FD6]` so the font stays a readable blue on hover.
- Build passes (2385 modules).

---

## August 31, 2026 10:31 AM (PHT) â€” prans
- Push of accumulated uncommitted work to `testbranch2` (5 requests this session).
- **Task 1 â€” Mark all as read font**: `Layout.tsx` bell dropdown "Mark all as read" button restyled to the uniform full-width style.
- **Task 2 â€” Search bar visibility**: added `bg-[#FBFDFF] shadow-sm ring-1 ring-blue-300` to the search inputs on `shared/UnifiedOrders`, `shared/UnifiedPaymentVerification`, `admin/InventoryManagement`, `admin/Staff`, `admin/AdminAttendance`, `shared/NotificationsPage`.
- **Task 3 â€” Inventory Active/Archived buttons**: moved the Active/Archived toggle next to "Add Item" in `admin/InventoryManagement.tsx` (2-col summary grid, matching button styling).
- **Task 4 â€” Staff AM/PM time-in/out**: `attendanceStore.ts` `getNextAction`/`timeIn`/`timeOut` are now period-aware (AM â†’ morning, PM â†’ afternoon; Time Out maps to the current active period). `staff/StaffTimesheet.tsx` + `shared/StaffTimeInGate.tsx` derive everything from `getCurrentPeriod()` + logs instead of the removed `nextAction` state; PHT date keys via `toDateKey(nowPHT())`.
- **Task 5 â€” System-wide PHT (UTC+8) time**: new centralized `src/app/utils/pht.ts` (toPHT/nowPHT/todayPHTKey/toPHTKey/formatPHTime/formatPHDate/formatPHDateTime) applied across all active display sites: announcements, order tracking, customer orders, customer dashboard notifications, shared orders (header clock + invoice + table + order-placed-at via `createdAt`), walk-in transactions, payment verification, admin attendance (adjust-dialog PHT input + late cutoff), ordersStore date key, new print request date, file-attachments upload date, Staff joinDate, job postedDate (JobApplyForm/JobBoardManagement/StaffProfile), JobBoard applied/interview dates. Dead/unrouted legacy files (AdminOrders, StaffQueueBoard, PaymentVerificationAdmin, staff/PaymentVerification) intentionally untouched.
- Also included earlier uncommitted work: Google Maps embed (LandingPage + CustomerDashboard), View Applicants uniform style (JobBoardManagement), per-user customer notifications (UnifiedOrders + NotificationsPage + Layout), bell badge removal (desktop + mobile), notification deep-open-to-order routing.
- Build passes (2386 modules).

---

## August 31, 2026 10:10 PM (PHT) â€” prans
- Push to `testbranch2`: fix Orders list time grouping to match the whole system.
- **Orders list time grouping fixed**: in `shared/UnifiedOrders.tsx`, the Orders table Time column already showed PHT (`formatPHTime`), but the Morning/Afternoon/Evening grouping headers used `date.getHours()` â€” the DEVICE-LOCAL hour, not PHT. On any browser outside the PH timezone, an order would show e.g. "09:00 AM" yet be grouped under the wrong time period. `getTimePeriod` now derives the hour in PHT via `toPHT(date).getHours()`, so the grouping matches the PHT time displayed system-wide.
- Note: the admin "Time In Limit" feature was implemented then removed (per user) before this push â€” no trace remains; `AdminAttendance.tsx` and `attendanceStore.ts` reverted to their committed state.
- Build passes (2386 modules).

---

## September 01, 2026 04:41 AM (PHT) â€” prans
- Push to `testbranch2`: system-wide header clock (internet GMT+8/Manila time) + New Print Request scroll-to-top.
- **Time utilities made timezone-independent**: `src/app/utils/pht.ts` rewritten. The old "add +8h then read device-local" hack double-added the offset on a GMT+8 device (showed 7am when it was actually 11pm). All "now"/format helpers now resolve the Manila wall-clock through `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with `timeZone: "Asia/Manila"`, so they are correct on any device. `nowPHT()` returns a synthetic Date whose device-local getters equal Manila wall-clock; `formatPHTime`/`formatPHDate` use Intl Manila directly. Internet sync (`syncInternetTime()`, worldtimeapi.org) still corrects a wrong device clock; kicked off globally in `src/main.tsx`.
- **`attendanceStore.ts`**: `nowPHT`/`formatPHT` delegate to the Intl Manila helpers (removed the +8h double-add); `formatPHT` now wraps `formatPHTime(d, { hour12:false })`.
- **Live header clock for ALL users**: `Layout.tsx` added a live clock immediately LEFT of the bell/notification icon in the shared top header (present on every authenticated page for customer/staff/admin). Desktop shows time + full date incl. year; mobile shows compact time with Clock icon. Styling: time text black, date darker blue `#2F6FD6`, reduced font sizes, no uppercase, "GMT+8" label removed. Ticks every second and re-renders once internet time resolves.
- **`UnifiedOrders.tsx` / `StaffTimesheet.tsx` / `StaffTimeInGate.tsx`**: all live clocks/timers/toast timestamps now use internet-corrected Manila time via `nowPHT()`/`toPHT()`/`internetUtcMs()`.
- **New Print Request includes images step auto-scroll**: pressing "Next Step"/"Back" in the Print Request stepper now scrolls back to the top. Root cause: the page scrolls inside Layout's `<main>` (`overflow-y-auto`), not the window, so the old `window.scrollTo(0,0)` did nothing. Added `scrollPageToTop()` (`NewPrintRequest.tsx`) which scrolls `document.querySelector("main")` (smooth) in addition to the window.
- Build passes (2386 modules).

## September 01, 2026 08:26 AM (PHT) â€” prans
- Push to `testbranch2`: multi-dimensional pricing matrix (store + admin + order-flow adoption) along with other accumulated updates.
- **Multi-dimensional pricing matrix (pricingStore)**: `src/app/utils/pricingStore.ts` gained a full pricing matrix on top of the legacy flat rates (legacy kept working, labelled "Legacy Per-Page Rates" on admin). New `ColorTier`/`ContentType`/`PaperSizeKey`/`PhotoSizeKey`/`ServiceType` types + `PricingMatrix` (document[content][color][size], vellum[color][size], sticker[color], photo[price/minQty]); `DEFAULT_MATRIX` with published prices (Photo 2R â‚±10 min 6 â€¦ A4 â‚±60); `STORAGE_VERSION` 1.0â†’2.0 (reseeds, matrix persisted). Store API: `getMatrix`/`updateMatrixCell`/`setMatrix`/`resetPricing` (+ matrix), `getPriceFromMatrix`, `resolveColorTier`, `mapPaperSizeKey`, label maps + `SERVICE_TAB_LABELS`. `admin/PricingManagement.tsx` rebuilt: tabs per service type (Document card-grids, Vellum colorÃ—size table, Sticker per-sheet, Photo price + min order) + Legacy rates section.
- **Order flow adopts matrix + Photo as per-file print type** (customer `NewPrintRequest.tsx` + shared `UnifiedWalkInTransactions.tsx`, both flows): Step-1 service-type selector (Document/Vellum/Sticker/Photo grid) and global Photo config panel REMOVED â€” every order uploads files in Step 1 and Photo is now a per-file **Print Type** in Step 2 with its own size/finish/qty (`FileData.printType` incl. `"photo"` + `photoSize/photoFinish/photoQty`, defaults `2R`/`matte`/`1`); per-file matrix pricing via `getPriceFromMatrix`, photo â†’ `matrix.photo[size].price * max(1, qty)` with per-file min-qty validation on submit; Step 2 print-type buttons styled like the Back button (`variant="outline"` grid, icons Layers/FileText/StickyNote/Camera); Step 1 headings fixed; Step 4 per-file cards + breakdown dialog show photo info; paper sizes capitalized. PRINT-TYPE HOVER/ACTIVE THEMING: `group` + `group-hover:text-white` on icons/labels (visible on the dark-blue outline hover fill â€” fixes the perceived "deselect"); selected button = filled blue `bg-[#2F6FD6] text-white`, `transition-all duration-150 active:scale-95` press animation.
- **Dead file-preview UI removed system-wide**: `file-attachments.tsx` dropped inert "View" button + `onView` prop (and unused `Eye`/`Button` imports); `OrderTracking.tsx` removed dead `handleViewFile`/`onView` (kept live "View Invoice"/"View Page Color Breakdown"); `UnifiedOrders.tsx` removed dead `onView`; removed now-unused `Eye` (both flows) + `SERVICE_TYPE_LABELS` (walk-in).
- Build passes.

## September 01, 2026 10:26 AM (PHT) â€” prans
- Push to `testbranch2`: merged pranswg's update (9 commits, 7d7f3761..4fc8fe95) with local Reports/dashboard/inventory work.
- **Dashboard full rewrite** (`admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`): header + welcome + date-range dropdown (This Month/Last Month/This Quarter/This Year/All Time/Custom), 3 tabs **Overview | Sales | Services**, no Inventory tab. Overview with 4 summary cards, Sales Trend area chart, Sales Comparison, Best Selling Services, Top Used Paper Sizes donut, Recent Transactions, **Inventory Snapshot** (Total/Low/Out cards + urgent items + "All inventory levels are currently healthy" + View Inventory button â†’ `/admin/inventory`). All data computed from `dataStore`/`inventoryStore`, no hardcoding.
- **Inventory Reports added** (`admin/InventoryManagement.tsx`): module nav "Inventory Overview | Reports"; Reports section with header + date filter (Today/This Week/This Month/Last Month/Custom), summary cards (Total/Low/Out/Stock In/Stock Out), Most Used Materials, Stock Movement bar chart, Inventory Alerts, Stock-In/Stock-Out history tables, Current Inventory Report table, category + item filters.
- **`inventoryStore.ts` stock-movement tracking**: new `StockMovement`/`StockMovementType` types + `movements[]` persisted to `localStorage('inventoryMovements')`, version bumped to `3.0`, `recordMovement()` helper; `stockIn`/`stockOut`/`deductPaperPieces` now record movements (person + reason); `getMovements(type?)`. `NewPrintRequest.tsx` `deductPaperPieces` call unchanged/backward-compatible.
- **Merged with pranswg's remote update**: pranswg redesigned `InventoryManagement.tsx` overview (2-col summary cards, Active/Archived toggle moved into the toolbar, white-base KPI button styling). The merge kept BOTH his overview redesign AND my Reports section â€” only the React import line conflicted (resolved to keep `useEffect` + `useMemo`).
- Build passes.

---

## September 01, 2026 09:21 PM (PHT) â€” prans
- Push to `testbranch2`: merged aeprnts's dashboard/inventory-reports work + expanded mock sales data for dashboard testing.
- **Merge commit** `100acb00` pulled in aeprnts's `96c41a6` ("Add dynamic admin dashboard (Overview/Sales/Services) & inventory reports; stock-movement tracking") â€” `AdminDashboard.tsx` 3-tab rewrite, `InventoryManagement.tsx` Inventory Overview | Reports toggle, `inventoryStore.ts` stock-movement tracking (v3.0, `inventoryMovements` localStorage). Only `PUSH_LOG.md` conflicted (kept both entries, oldestâ†’newest).
- **Mock customers** `c52332b0`: two online GCash orders seeded in `dataStore` for Payment Verification + Orders-list UI checking (Maria Santos pending / John Dela Cruz in-queue).
- **`src/app/utils/dataStore.ts`**: added **10 more seed orders** (`ORD-2026-0003` â†’ `ORD-2026-0012`) spanning **Junâ€“Sep 2026** so the admin dashboard has a multi-month **Sales Trend**, varied **Best Selling Services** (Colored/B&W/Photocopy/School Supplies), a filled **paper-size donut** (A4/Short/Long), meaningful **Total Sales / Orders / walk-in / active-customer** KPIs, and populated **Recent Transactions**. Kept the two Payment-Verification orders. Old months are mostly `Completed`/`Released`; one Aug order is `Canceled` (excluded from revenue); Sep has three completed/released today. First time the local branch reflects BOTH prans + aeprnts work in one history for aeprnts to pull.

---

## September 01, 2026 09:37 PM (PHT) â€” prans
- Push to `testbranch2`: fixed Admin Dashboard Sales tab â€” trend views now aggregate ALL orders regardless of the selected date range.
- **`src/app/components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`**: the Sales tab defaulted to a "This Month" range, so its Daily/Weekly/Monthly trend charts only surfaced September's few orders (looked flat/broken) while the Overview's Sales Trend (all-orders) looked fine. Fix: `dailySales`, `weeklySales`, AND `monthlySales` in `computeMetrics` now iterate over ALL orders (not the range-scoped `filtered`), so all three Sales-tab views show the full Junâ€“Sep history regardless of the dropdown. Added shared `MONTH_INDEX` constant + `sortByMonthDay()` helper so Daily/Weekly buckets sort chronologically (oldestâ†’newest) like Monthly. Range-scoped values (Total Revenue KPI, Sales Comparison, Best Selling, paper donut, recent transactions) unchanged. Build passes.

---

## September 01, 2026 10:45 PM (PHT) â€” prans
- Push to `testbranch2`: session persistence, legacy order pages deleted, and collapsed-sidebar fixes.
- **Session persistence (refresh no longer logs you out)**: the auth state now remembers the logged-in user across page reloads. Refreshing while signed in keeps you on the page instead of bouncing back to the login screen; signing out clears it, and the 15-minute inactivity auto-logout still works.
- **Deleted the dead legacy order pages**: `StaffQueueBoard` (staff) and `AdminOrders` (admin) were imported but never routed (live pages are `StaffOrdersUnified` under `/staff/queue` and `AdminOrdersUnified` under `/admin/orders`). Previewed them first via temporary routes, then removed the files, their dead imports, and the temporary routes, and cleaned up the leftover comments referencing them.
- **Fixed collapsed-sidebar hover labels**: in desktop collapsed mode, hovering an icon (like Payment Verification) showed the label floating at the bottom instead of beside the icon. Names are now positioned right next to the hovered icon, vertically centered on it, and clear when the sidebar scrolls.
- **Fixed the collapsed-sidebar Profile button**: clicking the profile avatar while collapsed used to open a floating dropdown over the rail. It now expands the whole sidebar first (showing the full profile button) and opens the profile menu, matching the intended behavior.

---

## September 2, 2026 12:47 AM (PHT) - prans
- Push to `testbranch2`: system-wide in-app confirmation dialogs for every significant data-changing action (no browser alerts).
- **Rebuilt the shared `ConfirmationDialog`** (`src/app/components/ui/confirmation-dialog.tsx`) so every module confirms with an EXACT action-name confirm button (e.g. `Place Order`, `Cancel Order`, `Stock Out`, `Save Changes`, `Approve Payment`, `Reject Payment`) and a SAFE cancel label (`Go Back`/`Keep Item`/`Keep It`). Older dialogs no longer force typing `Docufy` (`requirePhrase` is now opt-in and reserved for highly destructive/irreversible actions: Payment Method delete, Pricing reset, Order cancellation, Payment rejection, Attendance reset day, Notification delete). Optional `loading` prop shows a spinner and disables both buttons as a duplicate-submit guard. Destructive styling stays on deletes/rejects/cancels; positive/save/approve actions use the non-destructive state.
- **Confirmation added to customer flows**: New Print Request `Place Order` (confirms file count/pages/total + payment method before reserving paper and creating the order); Payment Verification `Submit Reference`/`Confirm Order` (queued for admin/staff approval); Job Board customer application `Submit Application` (portfolio file noted); Walk-in Transactions `Proceed to In Queue` (order summary + total before enqueueing).
- **Confirmation added to Notifications**: the old browser `confirm()` for deleting a notification was replaced with the shared dialog (type `Docufy` + `Delete Notification`/`Keep It`); broadcasting a new announcement now confirms `Send ... Notification` first. Removed the last remaining `window.confirm()`/`alert()` calls in the app.
- **Sign Out confirmation everywhere**: Layout desktop sidebar + top-right profile menu, the mobile nav sheet, and the Customer/Staff/Admin profile pages now confirm `Sign Out` (`Stay Signed In` to cancel).
- **Staff Timesheet**: Time In / Time Out actions now confirm (live timer context + session name shown).
- **Staff admin page**: the Activate/Deactivate staff dialogs now use exact buttons `Activate`/`Deactivate` (were generic `Confirm`).
- All of the above build cleanly (`npm run build` passes; only the pre-existing large-chunk warning remains).

## September 2, 2026 (PHT) - prans
- Inventory Low Stock / Out of Stock alerts: added an automatic inventory alert module that watches the inventory store and emits a system notification whenever an item drops to or below its minimum stock (`Low Stock`, amber, Important). If an item runs completely out of stock, it emits an emergency `Out of Stock` alert (red, Emergency) instead. Alerts only go to **Staff and Admin** (not customers), each alert fires once per item (a localStorage state prevents duplicates while the item stays at the same status), and a low-stock alert is promoted to emergency if the item later goes fully out of stock. New alerts show at the top of the notifications panel, and the bell icon shows a colored unread dot (red for emergency, amber for important).
- **Staff Inventory page**: added a new read-only **Inventory** page for staff at `/staff/inventory` in the sidebar (also reachable by clicking `View Inventory` on an alert). It shows summary cards, a papers-left (pieces) card, and a filterable table with `All` / `Low Stock` / `Out of Stock` filter chips, so staff can see low/out items at a glance without editing stock.
- **View Inventory action from notifications**: the `View Inventory` button on an inventory alert runs the correct page for the signed-in role â€” `/staff/inventory` for staff, `/admin/inventory` for admin.
- **Inventory-aware notifications**: the notifications page now renders inventory alerts with color-coded styling (red emergency border + icon / amber important border + icon). Because this is a system alert, it only shows a `View Inventory` button and cannot be marked read.
- **Dashboard inventory snapshot**: the admin dashboard's Inventory snapshot now uses the same shared status logic as the rest of the app to detect low/out items, so the snapshot and the alerts stay consistent with the inventory page.
- All of the above build cleanly (`npm run build` passes; only the pre-existing large-chunk warning remains).

---

## September 3, 2026 09:35 AM (PHT) â€” prans
- Push to `testbranch2`: merged aeprnts's inventory alerts / confirmation-dialog work into the local branch and landed the "Home" + order-list + nav-order changes.
- **Merged aeprnts's commits locally** (`0b5e2763` confirmation dialogs + `3b904ea7` inventory low/out alerts & staff inventory page), resolving import conflicts in `Layout.tsx` and `MobileNavSheet.tsx` by keeping both sides' icon imports (`Home` + `Boxes`). Build passes.
- **"Home" added to profile dropdowns**: the desktop sidebar, top-right profile menu, and mobile nav profile dropdowns now include a **Home** option that navigates back to the landing page (`/`) for all roles.
- **Order list columns + details dialog cleanup** (`unified/UnifiedOrders.tsx`): removed the Type/Pages/Copies columns (and their sort wiring) from the admin/staff orders table for a tidier list; collapsed the Print Job Details and Additional Information sections of the order-details dialog so each is one unified container with hairline-separated grid cells (Attached Files, status/payment, hold/cancel/notes, Verify Payment inside).
- **Admin & staff sidebar tab order** (`adminMenuItems.tsx` + all staff page menus + mobile nav): reordered in both sidebars to: Dashboard, Walk-in Transactions, Payment Verification, Orders, Inventory, Attendance (admin), Staff (admin), Job Board (admin), Pricing Management (admin), Content Management (admin), Notifications. Staff keeps its staff-only **Clock-In & Timesheet** right after Dashboard; both keep **Inventory** and **Notifications**; admin keeps **Payment Methods** after Payment Verification.
- Build passes.

---

- **Reverted the customer mobile responsive polish** (`98ed32a2`, reverts `140574d1`): the previous push added an Order Progress timeline to `OrderTracking`, turned the CustomerDashboard/CustomerOrders order lists into mobile card rows, added a "Start a New Order" CTA to the customer dashboard, and reworked the NewPrintRequest nav buttons. These were deemed incorrect and reverted wholesale â€” the customer files (CustomerDashboard, CustomerOrders, NewPrintRequest, OrderTracking) and the docs (AGENTS.md, PUSH_LOG.md) are back to their state before that commit. Build passes.

- **ENTER KEY = PRIMARY ACTION (system-wide)**: pressing Enter in any dialog, confirmation prompt, or form now triggers that context's primary action (submit/confirm) instead of nothing or a stray newline - while never hijacking multiline text areas (Enter still inserts a new line there) and never double-submitting. Centralized in the shared dialog so it applies everywhere with one change.
- **Shared DialogContent Enter handler** (`ui/dialog.tsx`): while a dialog is open, a document-level Enter listener (added per-open, removed on close) finds the dialog's primary action - a `button[type="submit"]` first, else an element marked `data-primary-action` - and clicks it exactly once after `preventDefault()` (blocks the native double-submit). It skips when focus is inside a `textarea` (newline preserved) or outside that dialog; `Shift+Enter` is never intercepted.
- **ConfirmationDialog now submits on Enter** (`ui/confirmation-dialog.tsx`): the header + phrase field + footer are wrapped in a `display:contents` form whose submit handler runs the confirm action, and the confirm button is now `type="submit"` (kept `disabled={!canConfirm || loading}` for the destructive/cancel/requirePhrase safety); the legacy `onKeyPress`/`handleKeyPress` dead logic was removed. Covers all 59 confirmation usages (Place Order, Cancel Order, Stock Out/In, Approve/Reject Payment, Delete Notification, Reset Pricing, Sign Out, Time In/Out, etc.).
- **Formless admin CRUD dialogs get `data-primary-action`** so Enter triggers their primary button (which previously did nothing because there was no `<form>`): Inventory Add/Edit + Stock In/Out, Staff Register/Edit, Payment Methods Add/Edit, Pricing Management matrix price + legacy rate editors, AdminAttendance Adjust Time, and AdminProfile Change Password. Form-based dialogs (Job Board, Staff/Job apply, Login/SignUp/ForgotPassword, customer Payment Verification) already submit natively via their `type="submit"` button + `<form onSubmit>`. Read-only detail/invoice dialogs (no meaningful primary action) are intentionally left alone. Build passes.

- **MOBILE HEADER - PROFILE ICON REMOVED, ACCOUNT VIA SIDEBAR ONLY**: the top-right circular avatar/profile button (and its dropdown) in the shared header (`Layout.tsx`) is now hidden at mobile widths for ALL roles (`{!isMobile && ...}` wraps it), so the mobile header stays clean and uncluttered at `hamburger | page title | notifications` with no empty gap. Desktop is unchanged - staff/admin/customer still open their profile from the top-right avatar and the desktop left sidebar. On mobile, account access is exclusively through the hamburger menu's sidebar (`MobileNavSheet`), which already has a clearly-tappable account section at its bottom (avatar + email/role + dropdown `Home` / `My Profile` / `Sign Out`); tapping `My Profile` closes the sidebar and lands on the full profile page (Account Settings / Personal Information / Change Password all live there), and the browser Back / profile back-arrow return to the previous page naturally via normal router history. No separate profile system created; existing account functionality untouched. Build passes.

## September 3, 2026 03:30 PM (PHT) - prans
- **LANDING PAGE "GET STARTED" CTA - ALWAYS SOLID FILLED**: the hero "Get Started" button (the Landing Page's primary CTA, navigates to `/signup`) is now always a filled primary-color button instead of the previous white/outline style. It uses `bg-[#1D73EC]` (Docufy customer primary blue) with white text for contrast, a desktop hover that darkens to `bg-[#10316B]` plus a subtle lift, and an `active:scale-95` pressed/active state for touch devices. It stays `size="lg"` (`h-10 px-6`) for a comfortable mobile tap target and gets a subtle blue shadow for extra prominence. The filled style is consistent on desktop, tablet, and mobile and never switches to an outline/transparent style at smaller widths. The button's functionality and destination (`/signup`) are unchanged. Build passes.

## September 3, 2026 04:00 PM (PHT) - prans
- **NOTIFICATIONS - SIDEBAR TAB REMOVED, ACCESS VIA HEADER BELL DROPDOWN**: removed the dedicated "Notifications" tab/item from EVERY sidebar (desktop left sidebar, admin menu, staff/customer mobile `MobileNavSheet`, and all per-page `menuItems` arrays passed to the shared Layout), so no empty space or broken nav item remains. The buried urgent-announcement dot on that sidebar item and its now-unused `urgentAnnouncements` state in Layout/MobileNavSheet were removed too. The original Notification page/routes (`/customer/notifications`, `/staff/notifications`, `/admin/notifications`) are UNCHANGED and still exist.
- **Header bell icon kept + "Show All Notifications" button**: the header bell stays fully functional on all screen sizes with its unread-count badge and dropdown (merged notifications + announcements feed). A new prominent solid-blue "Show All Notifications" button was added at the BOTTOM of that bell dropdown (below "Mark all as read") that closes the dropdown and navigates to the role's original Notifications page (`handleShowAllNotifications` -> `navigate('/{role}/notifications')`).
- **Navigation flow change**: access to the full Notifications page is now `Header Bell Icon -> Notification Preview/Dropdown -> Show All Notifications -> Original Notification Page` instead of `Sidebar -> Notifications -> Page`. No duplicate notification system, no second page, no bottom navigation bar, no broken routes or dead links. Build passes.

## September 3, 2026 06:30 PM (PHT) - prans
- **NOTIFICATION DROPDOWN - LARGER, READABLE PANEL**: the header bell dropdown is now a proper notification panel instead of a small compact popover. Width grew (20rem -> 24rem) and it got a max-height capped to the viewport (`max-h-[min(32rem,calc(100vh-6rem))]`) as a flex column so the header + footer buttons stay fixed while only the list scrolls. Each notification item is roomier and more legible: more horizontal/vertical padding, a bigger icon chip (40px, larger icon), larger title/message/time text, and a bigger unread dot. The header shows the title plus an "N unread" count, the empty state is larger, and the "Mark all as read" / "Show All Notifications" buttons are taller (h-11) with comfortable spacing. Responsive on mobile - it stays within the viewport width (`min(24rem, calc(100vw-1.5rem))`, right-anchored) and height so there is NO horizontal scrolling.
- **NOTIFICATION CLICK = VIEW FIRST, THEN MARK READ**: clicking a notification/announcement in the bell dropdown no longer just silently marks it read and closes. It now opens a DETAIL DIALOG that shows the type badge (Order / Payment / Status Update / Inventory Alert, or the announcement type), an Important/Emergency priority badge when applicable, the full title, the COMPLETE message, and the date/time (PHT). Mark-as-read now happens ONLY once the detail is opened/viewed, never before.
- **Action button + no accidental navigation**: if the notification has a destination, the detail dialog shows a primary action button - "View Order", "View Inventory", or "Go to Page" - that the user clicks to navigate to the relevant page (order tracking for customers, orders list for staff/admin, inventory for alerts). Notifications without a destination show a plain Close. Already-read notifications still open the same detail view. Notifications are never deleted or hidden when marked read and stay in the full Notifications page/history. "Mark all as read" remains its own separate action.

## September 3, 2026 08:15 PM (PHT) - prans
- **STAFF GAIN FULL INVENTORY ACCESS (same as admin)**: staff can now manage inventory exactly like the administrator instead of only viewing read-only stock levels. The read-only `StaffInventory.tsx` was replaced with a thin wrapper that reuses the shared admin `InventoryManagement` component (with the staff sidebar menu + "Inventory" title), and that admin component was made configurable (optional `menuItems`/`title` props, defaulting to the admin values) so the same full module serves both roles. Staff at `/staff/inventory` now have every capability admins do: Add/Edit items, Archive/Restore, Stock In / Stock Out, the Papers Left card, Low-Stock banner, summary cards, Active/Archived filters with search, and the Reports tab (material usage, stock-movement chart, inventory alerts, Stock-In/Out history, and Current Inventory report). Stocking actions record the acting staff member's name just like admin. This also means the inventory notification "View Inventory" action now lands staff on the full management page for both low-stock and out-of-stock alerts. Build passes.

## September 3, 2026 05:20 PM (PHT) - prans
- **SIGN OUT CONFIRMATION â†’ RED "LOG OUT" BUTTON (all roles)**: the Confirmation dialog's action button now reads "Log Out" instead of "Sign Out" and renders as a red (destructive) filled button with white text that darkens on hover - so the destructive intent is clear and the font color stays legible. Applied consistently across every sign-out confirmation (desktop sidebar, top-right profile dropdown, admin/staff/customer profile pages, and the mobile nav sheet).
- **ERROR USAGE CONFIRMATION ON ORDER COMPLETION**: staff/admin no longer auto-deduct paper when an order is placed. Instead, when marking an order **Completed**, a confirmation dialog opens showing the **Inventory items used** (each paper size with its expected sheet count). The dialog has a dropdown to select an **Error Usage reason** (Printing Error, Equipment Issue, Out of Ink, Paper Jam, Misalignment, Customer Request, Other) plus a **Wasted Sheets** counter. Two footer actions: **"No Errors"** confirms the order with no errors, and **"Confirm Error Usage"** (requires a reason) records the error. Only on completion does the expected paper get deducted from inventory (skipping legacy orders to avoid double-counting), and the error usage (reason + wasted sheets + no-errors flag) is stored on the order for audit.
- **ONE ORDER PER STATUS MOCK DATA**: the seeded orders were rebuilt so there is exactly one order for each status (Awaiting Payment, Received, In Queue, Printing, Completed, On Hold, Released, Canceled) instead of many duplicates - making each status card / filter demo cleanly.
- **TERMINAL STATUSES HIDDEN BY DEFAULT IN QUEUE**: Completed, Released, and Canceled orders no longer appear in the default orders list/view (alongside Awaiting Payment) - they only show when their specific status filter is selected, keeping the active queue focused on in-progress work.
- **STATUS BUTTON FONT COLOR FIXED (order details)**: the selected (active) status buttons in the order detail view - Received, In Queue, Printing, Completed, On Hold, Released - previously had solid blue/gray fills with dark default text (low contrast). They now use white text on the colored fill so the label is always readable. Build passes.

## September 4, 2026 11:31 AM (PHT) - Althea09-git
- **SERVICES & PRICING MOBILE REDESIGN** (LandingPage.tsx): the Services & Pricing section on mobile is now a compact, interactive 3-card carousel instead of large stacked vertical cards.
- **3 COMPRESSED CARDS**: redesigned the cards as (1) Standard Document Printing, (2) Binding & Finishing, and (3) Document Encoding & Layout, with a compact primary "Order Now" CTA at the bottom of each.
- **INTERACTIVE B&W / COLOR TOGGLE**: the Standard Document Printing card now has an inline pill toggle that switches between the B&W per-page rate and the Color per-page rate (and swaps the description), wired to the live pricing store.
- **CAROUSEL INTERACTION**: the cards form a horizontally swipeable/snapping slider with left/right navigation arrows and pagination dots at the bottom; the centered/active card gets a blue border + soft glow highlight that follows swipe, arrow, dot, or hover.
- **COMPACT + SQUARE LAYOUT**: reduced internal padding, icons placed inline next to the card headers, and mobile cards are square (aspect-square) instead of tall rectangles; hover uses a smooth elevation lift hover:-translate-y-1 hover:shadow-lg with the same 	ransition-all duration-300.

## September 4, 2026 (PHT) - prans
- **CUSTOMER SIDEBAR - NOTIFICATIONS TAB REMOVED (re-applied after PrintTransaction merge)**: the customer print-request page (`shared/PrintTransaction.tsx`, which now powers customer New Print Request after the print-flow unification) had re-introduced a "Notifications" tab in the customer sidebar menu. Removed it so the customer sidebar again shows only Dashboard, Print Request, My Orders, and Job Board - notifications are accessed only via the header bell dropdown (Bell -> "Show All Notifications" -> `/customer/notifications`), the same as before the unify. The staff menu in the same file is unchanged. Build passes.

## September 4, 2026 2:57 PM (PHT) - Althea09-git
- **SERVICES & PRICING MOBILE CARDS COMPACTED**: reduced card width to 200px, padding to p-4, icons/text/price all smaller for a more compact carousel on mobile; cards use a square (aspect-square) layout on mobile.
- **SERVICES & PRICING BLUE HIGHLIGHT FIXED**: removed the isManualNav guard that was blocking the scroll-based active-card detection; cards now highlight reliably on click/tap/swipe with a clear blue background tint (bg-[#F0F7FF]), thick blue border, blue ring, and strong shadow; added onTouchStart for reliable mobile tap detection.
- **CAROUSEL AUTO-CENTERS ACTIVE CARD**: added IntersectionObserver so the active card auto-scrolls to center when the Services & Pricing section enters the viewport; on initial page load the first card centers after a short delay; arrows/dots also scroll to center.
- **SHOP INFO CARDS SIDE-BY-SIDE ON MOBILE**: changed the grid from grid-cols-1 to grid-cols-2 so Shop Hours and Location sit in one row on mobile; cards made compact with smaller padding, icons, text, and a responsive stacked layout.
- **JOB OPENINGS COMPACT ACCORDION ON MOBILE**: replaced the large vertical job cards with a compact collapsible accordion list; collapsed row shows title, schedule, Active badge, and a rotating chevron; tap expands to reveal description and Apply Now button with smooth height animation; title wraps instead of truncating, 44px touch target, flexible header layout.
- **ABOUT DOCUFY INTERACTIVE ON MOBILE**: made the about card compact (p-5 instead of p-12) with a short one-line preview and a Show more/Show less toggle; expands with a smooth height animation; added hover lift effect; desktop keeps the full body.
- **FOOTER MINIMALIST ON MOBILE**: centered stack layout with smaller logo, shorter link labels (Terms/Privacy/Contact), subtle copyright, and clean spacing.

---

## September 4, 2026 3:09 PM (PHT) - Althea09-git
- **HEADER LOGO/TITLE ALIGNMENT**: grouped the logo icon and "Docufy PSMS" text with a fixed 8px (gap-2) flexbox gap at all screen sizes so they align cleanly on the left of the header (removed the larger desktop gap).
- **HERO TITLE SPACING FIX**: the hero title now trims the first segment of the stored heroTitle before rendering, so a saved "Print , Track" value displays cleanly as "Print, Track" (no stray space before the comma/output line break).
- **JOB OPENING ACCORDION HEADER CONSISTENCY**: moved the "Active" badge out of the job-title row and positioned it inline next to the "Schedule" text on its own line, so the job title (left) and the right-aligned chevron button stay perfectly vertically aligned regardless of title length; headers now share a uniform minimum height (min-h 52px).
- **SERVICES & PRICING PRICE ELEMENTS NORMALIZED**: normalized the pricing typography across all three cards into one consistent structure - currency symbol (â‚±) at small semibold, the price digit at a uniform 2xl bold, and the unit/qualifier (/ page, starting, / document) at a small medium-weight gray, all baseline-aligned so the currency, digit, and unit line up identically on every card.

## September 4, 2026 3:40 PM (PHT) - Althea09-git
- **ADMIN DASHBOARD MOBILE - METRIC CARDS (Overview)**: the four metric cards (Total Sales, Total Orders, Walk-in Transactions, Active Customers) now sit in a 2-column grid on mobile (grid-cols-2 gap-3) instead of full-width stacked cards. Card interiors compacted to p-3 rounded-xl with the icon left and label+value beside it (flex gap-3); labels are small gray (text-xs text-gray-500, uppercase on mobile), values are text-lg font-bold; the percentage trend stays but the "vs previous period" subtext is hidden on small screens to keep card height tight.
- **ADMIN DASHBOARD - SALES TREND CHART**: chart container height capped to h-48 on mobile (about 192px) so it stops causing excessive vertical scrolling, expanding back to 280px on desktop (lg).
- **ADMIN DASHBOARD - SALES COMPARISON CARD**: This Period and Previous Period changed from stacked blocks into a side-by-side 2-column grid on mobile (flex justify-between on desktop); the percentage badge was moved up onto the same line as the currency amount (e.g. â‚±625.00 + green/red trend pill); the "You earned â‚±X more/less..." summary note compacted to text-xs text-gray-500 with a reduced top margin and a slimmer progress bar (h-2 on mobile).
- **ADMIN DASHBOARD - RECENT TRANSACTIONS**: on mobile the transaction list now shows only the first 4 by default with a "See all N transactions / Show less" toggle button to reveal the full list (the header "View All" still links to the orders page). Rows compacted to py-2.5 vertical padding, keeping Order ID + type badge on top, customer name below, and price + Paid/Pending status badge on the far right.
- **ADMIN DASHBOARD - INVENTORY SNAPSHOT**: the three metric counts (Total Items, Low Stock, Out of Stock) were converted from a stacked list into a 3-column centered grid (grid-cols-3 gap-2 text-center) with compact gray boxes (p-2.5 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg) instead of large colored tiles. The "All inventory levels are currently healthy" message is now a compact single-line text-xs banner (flex gap-2 p-2 bg-green-50 text-green-700 rounded-md).

---

## September 4, 2026 3:50 PM (PHT) - Althea09-git
- **ADMIN DASHBOARD - SALES TAB METRIC CARDS (mobile)**: the four sales metric cards (Total Revenue, Highest Sales, Lowest Sales, Sales Periods) were converted from a vertical stack into a 2-column grid on mobile (grid-cols-2 gap-3). Cards compacted to p-3.5 rounded-xl; section titles are uppercase text-[10px] font-bold tracking-wider gray; key numbers are text-base font-bold gray-900. Highest/Lowest Sales now show the month as a compact green/red badge with the price underneath (tight grouping); Sales Periods keeps the count and "months with data" inline on the same row.
- **ADMIN DASHBOARD - SERVICES TAB TOP METRIC CARDS (mobile)**: the three cards (Most-Used Service, Best-Selling Revenue, Total Orders) were converted to a compact grid (grid-cols-2 on mobile, grid-cols-3 on desktop) with p-3 padding; section titles are uppercase text-[10px] font-bold gray; primary text is text-xs font-semibold gray-900 with the count/revenue shown as a small pill badge underneath. On mobile the third card (Total Orders) centers beneath the top two via col-span-2 + max-w-[50%] + centered flex column so the number and "all services" badge are balanced.
- **ADMIN DASHBOARD - SERVICES TAB BREAKDOWN TABLE (mobile)**: table padding compacted to py-2 px-2.5 with text-xs; the "% of Total" column is hidden on mobile and replaced by a mini inline blue progress bar under each service name; the table wrapper is w-full overflow-x-auto.
- **ADMIN DASHBOARD - SERVICES TAB REVENUE CHART (mobile)**: the Revenue by Service bar chart container was capped to h-44 on mobile (restoring to 300px on desktop) to prevent excessive vertical scrolling.

## September 4, 2026 5:02 PM (PHT) - Althea09-git
- **HEADER CLOCK / TITLE COLLISION FIX (all dashboard views)**: in the shared Layout header (src/app/components/Layout.tsx), the page-title container gained min-w-0 flex-1 and the h1 gained min-w-0 truncate, while the hamburger/back buttons got shrink-0 and the live clock + notification bell container got flex-shrink-0. Long page titles now truncate cleanly instead of pushing the live timestamp/bell off-screen on narrow mobile viewports. Because this is the single shared header, it applies globally to Attendance, Orders, Job Board, Inventory, and every other dashboard page.
- **ADMIN JOB BOARD - COMPACT CARDS WITH ACCORDION (mobile)**: job cards are now compact by default showing only the Title, Job Type tag, Applications count chip, and action buttons; the full description is hidden behind a collapsible accordion ("Show description"/"Hide description" with animated height + rotating chevron) via a new expandedJobId state. Action buttons are grouped in a flex items-center justify-between row with compact text-xs styles so they no longer overflow the right edge. Duration, Applications, and Posted ID were condensed into a single horizontal stats bar (flex gap-4 text-xs text-gray-500 py-2 border-t border-gray-100).
- **ADMIN JOB BOARD - APPLICANTS VIEW (mobile)**: the applicants header is now left-aligned and stacks vertically on mobile with the "Back to Job Postings" button above the title; the title is compact (text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 on mobile, restoring to text-2xl on desktop) and the subtitle is smaller (text-xs text-gray-500). The empty state is a full-width centered card (p-8 text-center bg-gray-50/50 border-dashed rounded-xl) with an Inbox icon and helper text for a balanced look.
- **ORDERS - STATUS METRIC CARDS COMPACT GRID (mobile)**: the 8 status cards on the Orders management page (shared UnifiedOrders) now sit in a 2-column grid on mobile (grid-cols-2, expanding to 4 on desktop) with compact p-2.5 cards, smaller icon chips, text-lg bold counts, and the descriptive subtext hidden on mobile (hidden sm:block). Filter-on-click, hover, and active blue highlight behavior preserved.
- **WALK-IN REVIEW SCREEN - 2-ROW ACTION BUTTONS (mobile)**: on the walk-in review step (PrintTransaction step 4), the bottom buttons are re-laid out in two rows - a top grid-cols-2 row with Back (secondary) and Cancel Order (red), and a full-width "Proceed to In Queue" blue primary CTA below (touch-friendly py-2.5/py-3 text-xs/sm) instead of a crowding single row.
- **NUMBER OF COPIES + QUANTITY UNIFIED STEPPER (both flows)**: replaced the plain numeric inputs for "Number of Copies" and (photo) "Quantity" with a single reusable NumberStepper control - a minus (-) button, a centered editable number field, and a plus (+) button in a bordered rounded container with touch-friendly padding. The input keeps a temporary string draft state so users can backspace/erase cleanly, with the value clamped back to the minimum on blur. The minus button is disabled at the minimum threshold, and clicking +/- immediately recalculates and updates the file's subtotal. For photo Quantity, the minimum is the size's minimum-batch requirement from the pricing matrix (e.g. 2R min 6); for copies it is 1.

## September 4, 2026 9:20 PM (PHT) - prans
- REAL GCASH REFERENCE-NUMBER OCR DETECTION (customer PaymentVerification): replaced the fake/mock auto-detect with real OCR via Tesseract.js (client-side, worker cached). The uploaded payment screenshot is preprocessed (upscaled, grayscale, contrast boost) so light-gray ""Ref No."" / ""Reference Number"" / ""Ref. No."" labels become readable, and the digits right after the label are extracted even when the number wraps across two rows; falls back to a standalone digit run only when no label is found, preferring a ~13-digit GCash-style length to avoid grabbing random numbers/phone numbers. The detected number auto-fills into the still-editable reference field (the user keeps the image preview to review/correct); a scanning spinner shows while OCR runs.
- AUTO-DETECT IS GCASH-ONLY + INFO NOTES: the OCR auto-scan only runs when the selected payment method is GCash. Informational notes added in two places only: (1) admin ''Add/Edit Payment Method'' dialog says automatic reference-number detection only works for GCash; (2) the customer print-request payment method section shows a note when a non-GCash online method (e.g. Maya) is chosen, explaining the reference is entered manually for that method.
- PROOF-OF-PAYMENT ACTION BUTTONS (PaymentVerification): the ''View'' button was restyled to match the ''Change'' button (same white/bordered/hover look), and a red X remove button was added beside Change to clear the uploaded file, preview, and any auto-detected reference.
- DARKER BUTTON OUTLINES (system-wide ui/button.tsx): the default/outline/secondary button variants changed their light blue border (border-blue-200) to a darker more visible border-blue-400 so outline buttons like ''Back'' are clearly visible.
- PRINT OPTION SELECTED LEFT-BORDER INDICATORS (PrintTransaction): the selected Color Mode option and Photo Finish option now keep their full selected style plus a soft rounded blue left-edge indicator bar; the Photo Finish (Matte/Glossy) options were re-stacked vertically (Glossy top, Matte below) and the photo panel re-arranged so Photo Size + Quantity stack on the left and Finish on the right.
- TIGHTER ORDERS & PAYMENT-VERIFICATION TABLES: reduced column horizontal padding (px-6 to px-4), narrowed the # column (w-16 to w-12), tightened the avatar-to-customer-name gap (gap-3 to gap-2), and matched the Orders period group-row padding, so the numbers, customer names, and categories sit closer together.

## September 5, 2026 8:17 AM (PHT) - agopr
- **Customer Dashboard complete redesign**: order-focused layout with welcome greeting first, 3 summary cards (Total Orders, In Progress, Ready for Pickup), prominent Current Order section with 4-step progress timeline, Recent Orders list with search, and blue Shop Hours + Quick Tips cards.
- **Shared AnnouncementDetailsModal**: new reusable component (`src/app/components/shared/AnnouncementDetailsModal.tsx`) used by both the dashboard announcement banner and the Layout notification dropdown for a consistent announcement viewing experience.
- **Dashboard announcement banner**: clickable cards (no arrow/CTA) for important/emergency announcements that open the shared modal; all urgent banners shown (emergency first).
- **Layout header improvements**: added `headerSearch` prop for optional search field, enlarged notification bell for better touch interaction.
- **TypeScript fixes across 7 stores**: fixed `Set.delete()` returning boolean in subscribe cleanup functions (dataStore, notificationStore, attendanceStore, applicationsStore, ordersStore, jobsStore, paymentMethodsStore) causing `useEffect` type errors; fixed CustomerProfile null/undefined mismatch and implicit `any` on setFormData callbacks.

---

## September 5, 2026 8:50 AM (PHT) - agopr
- **Staff Dashboard complete redesign**: removed Quick Actions, Shop Hours, and Staff Reminders. Replaced with operational-first layout: 4 summary cards (Total Orders, On Hold, In Progress, Ready for Pickup), Orders Requiring Attention section (on-hold and unverified-payment orders with issue details), Active Orders queue table (desktop table + mobile stacked list with position, customer, service, status, source, and time ago), Inventory Status panel (total/low/out-of-stock counts with problem item list), and Recent Activity feed.
- **Staff Dashboard data sources**: now subscribes to both ordersStore and inventoryStore for live reactive data across all operational sections.

---

## September 5, 2026 9:09 AM (PHT) - agopr
- **Notifications page redesigned as a compact unified inbox**: removed the separate "Important Announcements" section and oversized notification cards. Announcements and order/payment/status/inventory system notifications now live in ONE list, grouped by Philippines date (TODAY / YESTERDAY / MONTH DAY). Each item is a compact row — small tinted icon, single-line title (bold when unread), one-line message, PHT timestamp, and a small unread dot. Priority is shown through subtle indicators only: small red Emergency / amber Important badges, a thin colored left border, and a faint background tint — no loud full-card backgrounds. Clicking any item opens the SAME shared AnnouncementDetailsModal (mark-as-read happens only once viewed; read items stay visible and clickable). Compact pill filters added: All / Unread / Announcements / Orders / Inventory. Top area is now just the header, an unread-count pill, and "Mark all as read". Inline action links ("View Inventory" / "View Order") appear only on notifications that genuinely need one. Admin's Create Notification button/dialog and hover delete actions preserved. Content centered at a comfortable width with clean responsive mobile stacking.
- **Inventory removed from the customer-facing Notifications page (role separation)**: inventory is an internal operational module, so customers no longer see the Inventory filter chip — the filter row is now role-aware (customers see All / Unread / Announcements / Orders only; the Inventory filter appears exclusively for Staff and Admin). Customer notification feeds also skip inventory-type notifications defensively, so no internal stock/low-stock/out-of-stock information can surface to customers. Admin and Staff inventory functionality (pages, menus, dashboards, stock alerts, paper tracking) is unchanged.

## September 5, 2026 1:57 AM (PHT) - prans
- MERGED COLLABORATOR DASHBOARD/INBOX REDESIGN WITH LOCAL UI BATCH: merged origin/testbranch2 (agopr's Customer Dashboard redesign, Staff Dashboard as operational control center, unified Notifications inbox w/ shared AnnouncementDetailsModal, Layout headerSearch, and TS fixes across 7 stores) into the local testbranch2 alongside the uncommitted UI-polish + shop-photos + online-payment-draft batch. Conflicts were limited to the two dashboard files (auto-merge kept everything else, incl. OrderTracking). Resolutions: StaffDashboard kept the collaborator's operational redesign wholesale (the local activeOrders crash-fix was already inherent); CustomerDashboard kept the collaborator's new layout and RE-ADDED the local Shop Photos gallery into the blue Shop Hours card (toggle + 3-col thumbnail grid + full-screen lightbox dialog) since the collaborator's redesign had removed the old Shop Location map dialog the gallery lived in. Both works now coexist; build passes.
- SHOP PHOTOS RE-SETTLED INTO SHOP HOURS CARD (customer dashboard): the shop-photos gallery ("View Shop Photos"/"Hide Shop Photos" toggle + thumbnail grid + lightbox, backed by shopPhotosStore) now lives inside the blue Shop Hours card of the redesigned customer dashboard instead of the removed Shop Location map dialog - the thumbnails use white/20 borders and a white/80 toggle label to sit on the blue card, and the lightbox is unchanged.
- CUSTOMER DASHBOARD SEARCH FIELD IN HEADER (collaborator, kept): the redesigned dashboard passes a search field into the shared Layout header (new headerSearch prop) that filters Recent Orders live by order id/service/file/status; the announcement banner renders all important/emergency announcements (emergency first) as clickable cards opening the shared AnnouncementDetailsModal.

---

## September 5, 2026 3:03 PM (PHT) - agopr
- **TypeScript installed + strict typecheck added (repo-wide)**: the project previously had no `typescript` package or tsconfig.json, so `npm run build` (vite/esbuild) stripped types without ever checking them — errors only showed up in the VS Code TS server and two genuine runtime bugs (an undefined `showLabels` reference in Layout, and hooks placed after an early return in MobileNavSheet) went unnoticed. Added `typescript@7.0.2`, `@types/react-dom`, `@types/node` as devDependencies, a `tsconfig.json` (strict mode, unused-locals/params disabled to tolerate dead legacy files, `moduleResolution: bundler`, `@/*` path alias), and a new `"typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"` npm script. Fixed all ~140 reported errors across ~20 files so `npm run typecheck` now exits clean.
- **UnifiedOrders runtime crash fixed**: added the missing `const navigate = useNavigate()` (the hook was imported but never assigned, so clicking "Verify Payment" in an order detail would throw at runtime) and aligned the page's local `OrderType` with the orders store (added the `awaitingPayment` status, `paymentMethod`, `paymentProofUrl`, `customerEmail`, `specificPages`, `cancellationReason`, and loosened the string-union fields) so the store's orders typecheck against it.
- **Store type widenings to satisfy strict TS**: `ordersStore.ts` OrderType gained `customerEmail`/`specificPages`; `jobsStore.ts` JobType gained `salary?`/`schedule?`; removed stray `id`/`description` fields from mock literals in `dataStore.ts`/`inventoryStore.ts`; typed the reduce in `invoiceUtils.ts`; fixed the `NodeJS.Timeout` reference in `sessionManager.ts` (now `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>`); made the candidates args in the Staff/JobBoard/JobApply proposal maps typed; non-null-asserted `orderId` in customer PaymentVerification. No feature behavior changed — purely type/compile correctness.
- **Docufy sidebar restructured to 7 core items under section headings (IA redesign)**: the single sidebar is now organized under three non-clickable section headings — MAIN (Dashboard, Orders, Payment Verification, Walk-in Transactions, Inventory), OPERATIONS (parent Operations -> Attendance, Job Board), and MANAGEMENT (parent Management -> Staff, Payment Methods, Pricing Management, Content Management). Orders and Payment Verification stay directly accessible first-level items (no longer nested under Transactions); the old "Transactions" parent (which grouped Walk-in, Payment Verification, Payment Methods) is gone. Only Operations and Management act as expandable/collapsible parent rows whose children (Attendance/Job Board and Staff/Payment Methods/Pricing/Content) render indented inline in the SAME sidebar — no second sidebar, flyout, or secondary panel. Staff nav mirrors the same MAIN/OPERATIONS structure (Operations -> Clock-In & Timesheet) with admin-only items hidden. Rebuilt in `navigationConfig.tsx` (single source of truth) and applied to both the desktop sidebar (`Layout.tsx`) and the mobile drawer (`MobileNavSheet.tsx`).
- **Parent expansion persists across pages**: new `navExpandState.ts` holds a module-level snapshot of which parent rows are expanded, so a manually-opened Operations/Management group stays expanded while navigating between pages (Layout remounts every route). Active child routes still auto-expand their parent (e.g. /staff or /admin/staff opens Management with Staff highlighted). Collapsed (icon-only) sidebar still auto-expands on parent click so children never spawn a separate panel.

## September 6, 2026 9:41 AM (PHT) - aeprnts
- UNIFIED SUMMARY CARD COMPONENT (standardized KPI/stat cards, styling only): new shared `src/app/components/ui/summary-card.tsx` — a single `SummaryCard` built EXACTLY on the Admin Dashboard Overview master design (the old `StatCard`): `w-11 h-11 rounded-xl` blue icon chip + `w-5 h-5` icon on the LEFT, label `text-xs font-medium text-slate-500` truncate, value `text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 leading-tight`, optional `subtitle` row (`text-[11px] text-slate-400`), card shell `p-4 rounded-xl border border-slate-200/70 bg-white shadow-[0_1px_2px_rgba(15,23,42,0.04)] flex items-center gap-4`. Props keep status/color variation legal (`iconBg`/`iconColor`/`labelColor`/`valueColor`, clickable hover border, `active` filter state = accent border + tinted bg, `highlight` filled-blue variant for the Payment Verification "Total Verified" card). The AdminDashboard Overview `StatCard` was DELETED and its 4 KPI cards (Total Sales/Total Orders/Walk-in/Active Customers) now render through `SummaryCard` (trend row preserved via a new local `TrendText` helper). Every standalone summary/KPI/stat card was converted to the SAME component so the icon-left / label-above-value / identical size+typography+padding structure is consistent everywhere: Staff Dashboard 4 KPI cards, InventoryManagement main Items/Low-Stock cards + Reports-tab 5 stat cards (keep their green/amber/red status value colors), AdminAttendance 4 KPI cards (corner-icon + hover-fill-to-blue layout removed), PaymentMethodsManagement 3 cards, UnifiedPaymentVerification 4 filter cards + highlighted Total Verified (local `SummaryCard` removed), StaffTimesheet 3 metric cards (Today value + "Today · This week: X" subtitle), and UnifiedOrders 8 order-status filter cards (kept pastel meaning via status icon chip/label colors + active border/bg, click-to-filter preserved). Grid widths/columns stay per-module/responsive; only the card structure is unified. NOT touched (deliberately): Dashboard Sales/Services tab icon-less summary cards (already master-consistent), the Dashboard InventorySnapshot mini-tiles, and the Inventory "Papers Left" content card — table cards, form containers, content/detail/modal cards are unchanged. Typecheck + build pass.
- COMPACT RESPONSIVE LAYOUT (styling only, layout preserved): tightened the app-wide spacing so the dashboard and management pages feel consistently dense on small-scale laptops (100% display scaling, 1366×768) without changing card placement, data, functionality, or colors. Root font stays 16px (no zoom/transform workaround). Shared `Layout.tsx`: page content wrapper padding went `p-3 sm:p-6 lg:p-8` → `p-4 sm:p-5 lg:p-6` (desktop margins 32px→24px, standard 4px rhythm throughout all pages) and the top header horizontal padding aligned to match (`px-4 sm:px-5 lg:px-6`); header height, sidebar width (`w-64` / collapsed `w-[72px]`), and the blue sidebar styling are unchanged. Admin Dashboard: outer container and each tab (`Overview`/`Sales`/`Services`) spacing `space-y-6`→`space-y-5`, section-grid gaps `gap-6`→`gap-4 sm:gap-5`, `SectionCard` header `px-6 pt-5 pb-3`→`px-5 pt-4 pb-2.5` with body `px-6 pb-5`→`px-5 pb-4` and title weight `font-bold`→`font-semibold`, KPI card padding `p-4 sm:p-5`→`p-4`, Chart heights trimmed (Sales Trend `lg:h-[280px]`→`[260px]`, Sales tab chart 320→300, Revenue by Service `lg:h-[300px]`→`[280px]`), Recent Transactions rows `py-2.5`→`py-2`, and the tab bar `py-3`→`py-2.5`. Staff and Customer dashboards mirrored the same vertical rhythm (`space-y-6 pb-10`→`space-y-5 pb-8`). Typecheck + build pass.
- ADMIN DASHBOARD REDESIGN (visual polish, layout preserved, blue sidebar KEPT): restyled the shared `Layout.tsx` sidebar, header, and canvas plus the Admin Dashboard cards/charts/tables as a clean, modern SaaS aesthetic WITHOUT moving any card (Overview stays 4 KPI cards → Sales Trend (2/3) + Sales Comparison → Inventory Snapshot (2/3) + Recent Transactions; Sales/Services tabs unchanged). The sidebar REMAINS Docufy blue (`bg-[#1D73EC]`) with its established identity — white/light text and icons, section labels as blue-100/70 uppercase, white active pills (`bg-white text-[#1D73EC]`), 2px white/40 dividers, white profile avatar with blue initials — only its spacing/alignment/typography were refined (focus ring softened to `#1D73EC`/40, divider/avatar shadows removed). The canvas went `#f0f4f8` → neutral `#f6f7f9`, and the top header dropped its drop shadow (white, slate bottom border). The mobile nav sheet (`MobileNavSheet.tsx`) mirrors the same blue sidebar. Dashboard cards use `bg-white` + `border-slate-200/70` + a barely-there shadow (`0 1px 2px rgba(15,23,42,0.04)`) with `rounded-xl`; KPI StatCards got a unified blue icon chip (`bg-blue-50 text-[#2F6FD6]` — the old green/purple/orange tints are gone), a small muted label, a large semibold value, and a green/red trend arrow with a muted caption; Sales/Services summary cards and the Services breakdown table got the same label/value hierarchy; Recent Transactions' "Walk-in" chip went purple → slate; all three chart tooltips are now rounded with a soft border/shadow and the area lines are thinner with smaller dots. Header page title uses semibold tracking-tight. NO functionality, data, routes, or card positions changed — this is styling only. Typecheck + build pass.

## September 6, 2026 1:43 PM (PHT) - prans
- MERGED LATEST UPSTREAM + PUSHED WORKING-TREE BATCH: pulled origin/testbranch2 (aeprnts' SummaryCard standardization + sidebar polish commit 915b5bcc, fast-forward) then re-applied this session's uncommitted changes via stash pop. Two conflicts resolved: CustomerDashboard kept the collaborator's compact spacing while keeping this session's gap-0 card styling + status-label work and the deliberate header-search removal (the merged Layout call had kept `headerSearch={searchField}` from upstream but the search feature was intentionally removed in-session, so the prop was dropped to match); UnifiedPaymentVerification kept the collaborator's new `SummaryCard highlight` Total Verified card with the malformed `?` currency prefix corrected to `₱`.
- ORDER TRACKING CURRENCY/AMOUNT CLEANUP (`UnifiedPaymentVerification.tsx`): fixed `?NaN` totals by parsing amounts with `parseFloat(String(total).replace(/[₱?,\s]/g, "")) || 0` and standardized every peso display (stats card, Amount column, detail dialog, verify/reject descriptions, invoice totals in `UnifiedOrders`/`PrintTransaction`) away from a literal `?` prefix to `₱`.
- ORDER DETAILS VIEW/PRINT (admin/staff `file-attachments.tsx`): added `showView`/`showPrint` props with Eye/Printer icon buttons beside Download plus a hidden print iframe (`handleView`/`handlePrint`), enabled in `UnifiedOrders` (OrderTracking unaffected). Print/View work when `attachedFiles[].url` exists (same-session blob URL); real multi-device needs a backend URL.
- REMOVED MOJIBake `?` GLYPHS: stripped stray `? ` prefixes (corrupted charset glyphs) that appeared in rendered text — Order Source badge (`?? Online`→`Online`/`?? Walk-in`→`Walk-in`) and Payment Status badges (`? Verified`→`Verified`, `? Not Verified`→`Not Verified`, `? Pending`→`Pending`) in `UnifiedOrders.tsx`; verified no `'? X'`/"? X" strings remain.
- ORDER TRACKING PAGE POLISH (customer): page container `space-y-8`→`space-y-4`; merged the separate On-Hold and Awaiting-Payment alert cards INTO the single Current Status card (label + inline Action Required/Payment Pending badge, with Reason/What-to-do rendered below a divider, no duplicated terms); eliminated internal Card gaps (`gap-0` on Order Details and Payment Method) and tightened title margins; added a `formatPaperSize` helper so displayed paper size is capitalized (`short`→`Short`, `a4`→`A4`, etc.); tightened the merged status-card divider spacing (mt-2→mt-0) so there's no big gap under Current Status.
- MOBILE BACK BUTTON MOVED BELOW HEADER (all customer pages): adopted the CustomerOrders Top Action Bar pattern — `hideMobileBackButton` on the shared Layout (removes the in-header arrow) plus a mobile-only back arrow at the top of the page content. Applied to OrderTracking, JobBoard, JobApplyForm, CustomerProfile, PaymentVerification, and PrintTransaction (customer New Print Request). Desktop back button unchanged.
- CUSTOMER PRINT REQUEST "SEE COLORED PRICING BREAKDOWN" BUTTON (`PrintTransaction.tsx`): outline now gray (`border-gray-300`, `text-gray-600`) at rest and fills blue on hover (`hover:bg-[#2F6FD6] hover:border-[#2F6FD6] hover:text-white`) instead of the static blue outline.

## September 6, 2026 2:10 PM (PHT) — agopr
- **MERGED ORDER LIFECYCLE OVERHAUL WITH COLLABORATOR'S LATEST (universal payment gate + configurable deadlines + auto-expiry, then merged into testbranch2)**: pushed the complete order-lifecycle overhaul (committed locally as `2bdbb0f8`) merged with Francis's remote commit `1da05b1f` (Order Tracking polish, mobile back buttons, mojibake removal, pricing button restyle, file-attachments tweaks). Pull merged cleanly except for 3 files: `OrderTracking.tsx` (kept the customer banner with the new payment-deadline + live countdown merged with the collaborator's status-banner polish and its `getCustomerStatusLabel`), `UnifiedPaymentVerification.tsx` (kept our payment-kind-aware amount grid — Cash: Amount to Pay + Payment Deadline + Awaiting Payment at Shop; Online: Order Total/Amount Paid/Remaining Balance — over the collaborator's simpler "Amount to Verify" card), and `orderStatusPalette.ts` (kept our trimmed status key while adopting the collaborator's `"Awaiting Verification"` → `awaitingPayment` mapping and the new `getCustomerStatusLabel` export). Typecheck + build pass.
- **Universal payment gate — every order starts Awaiting Payment (cash AND online)**: customer orders are always created `Awaiting Payment` with a `paymentDeadline` computed from two admin-configurable hours in the pricing store's `Order Rules` (`cashPickupPaymentHours` default 48, `onlinePaymentVerificationHours` default 24; `0` = no auto-expiry — flagged PLACEHOLDERS pending client confirmation) and a cash `holdReason` is always set; online orders have no holdReason. The new UNIVERSAL flow: **Awaiting Payment → In Queue → Printing → Completed → Released (+ Canceled)**. Walk-in orders go straight to `inQueue` (paid at the shop, `paymentVerified: true`) with no deadline. The old `Received` and `On Hold` statuses are REMOVED everywhere.
- **Payment deadlines auto-expire (new `src/app/utils/paymentExpiry.ts`, 30s interval)**: any `Awaiting Payment` order whose deadline passed AND nothing is verified is auto-canceled → `Canceled`, `cancellationReason: "Payment Deadline Expired"`, deadline cleared, staff/admin + customer notifications fire; verified orders never expire and orders without a deadline are never touched. Legacy seeds carry far-future `2026-09-30` deadlines so they stay pending instead of being canceled on load.
- **Customer Payment Verification reworked**: the order is loaded from the store; the old cash "Confirm Order" button was replaced with a guidance/track card (cash: "nothing to submit online; pay at the shop") plus an Amount Paid input (preset to the required amount) persisted to the order (`paymentAmountPaid`) for online/down submissions. The new `Shared PaymentDeadlineCountdown` (live PHT countdown) shows on the customer tracking/verification pages.
- **Staff/Admin Payment Verification is payment-kind-aware**: `PaymentType` gained `kind: cash | online | online-down`, `totalAmount`, `amountPaid`, `remainingBalance`, `deadline?`; the detail dialog now distinguishes Cash on Pickup (Amount to Pay + Payment Deadline + live countdown + "confirm only once paid in cash") from Online Full vs Online Down (Total/Paid/Remaining Balance due on pickup); approving a payment now sets the status to **In Queue** (was Received) so the order enters the queue AUTOMATICALLY.
- **Queue page updated to the new lifecycle**: 8 summary cards trimmed to 6 (All Orders/In Queue/Printing/Completed/Released/Canceled; Received/On Hold cards removed), detail actions are CONTEXTUAL (In Queue → Start Printing/Cancel, Printing → Mark Completed, Completed → Release, Awaiting Payment → auto-queue note + Cancel, Released/Canceled → no actions), the "Start Here" next-to-process tag targets the earliest in-queue order, and cancelling now persists `cancellationReason` (shown in the detail dialog alongside the auto-expiry reason). A guard blocks moving an unverified awaiting-payment order into the queue. On Hold KPI → Awaiting Payment on the Staff dashboard; `invoiceUtils` fallback default → `Completed`; `dataStore`/`ordersStore` round-trip `paymentDeadline`/`paymentAmountPaid`/`cancellationReason`/payment fields and migrate legacy `Received`/`On Hold` entries to `inQueue` on load; `getOrderStats` dropped received/onHold keys.

## September 6, 2026 11:59 PM (PHT) - aeprnts
- OVERALL UI TEXT VISIBILITY IMPROVED (system-wide readability pass): darkened the global `--muted-foreground` design token in theme.css (#717182 -> #5C5D6E) and bumped secondary/supporting text one step darker (slate-400->500, gray-400->500) across the admin/staff UI - subtitles, table secondary info, timestamps, order IDs, card descriptions, empty states, filters, labels, and icon grays all read more legibly. Shared components got stronger headers (SummaryCard label slate-600 + medium subtitle, TableHead semibold), and sidebar nav links went text-white/90 semibold so they read cleanly against the Docufy blue. Customer-facing/public pages were deliberately left with their lighter text.
- PAYMENT VERIFICATION PAGE REDESIGN (admin + staff, presentation only): rebuilt UnifiedPaymentVerification into a compact professional workspace - tightened container (max-w-[1600px]), title + subtitle + search header, 5 SummaryCards (Pending Verification / Verified Today / In Queue / Cancelled+Expired / Total Verified Today), a compact 3-dropdown filter bar (Status / Type / Method), and a single rounded 7-column table with # priority circle badges (blue+halo for the first pending, small green/red checks for verified/rejected), kind-aware Amount cells, compact status pills, and a View action that opens a details dialog (customer header, order/payment/amount cards with live deadline countdown, QR panel, reference + proof, then real Verify / Reject actions). Row order is always automatic priority FIFO (pending first, oldest first); priority is never a manual sort. No workflow logic changed.
- SALES TAB REDESIGN (admin): rebuilt the Admin Dashboard Sales tab as a clean analytics workspace - header + subtitle, 4 KPI SummaryCards (Total Revenue / Total Orders / Average Order Value / Sales Growth with trends), a primary Sales Trend card with a Daily/Weekly/Monthly segmented pill switcher and improved chart, a Sales by Service breakdown with progress bars (View Services -> Services tab), and a Recent Sales compact table (View All -> /admin/orders). Removed the old Highest/Lowest Sales and Sales Periods cards. `SectionCard` gained a `headerRight` prop (non-breaking).
- STAFF DASHBOARD = ADMIN OVERVIEW: StaffDashboard is now pixel-identical to the Admin Dashboard Overview (with the two sales cards removed). AdminDashboard became role-aware via props; for staff it renders the same Overview layout - date-range selector, 4 KPI SummaryCards with trends, Recent Transactions (1/3, View All -> /staff/queue), and Inventory Snapshot (2/3, View Inventory -> /staff/inventory) - with no Sales Trend, no Sales Comparison, and no Sales/Services tabs. Staff greeting uses the staff user's first name.
- PRIORITY COLUMN = "#" + DUPLICATE-NUMBER FIX: the Payment Verification and Orders table headers now read "#" instead of "Priority". Fixed a bug where every seed order collapsed to the same `PAY-2026` payment id, causing both pending rows to show the same number ("2") and "Next to Verify" to match every pending row; each payment now uses its unique order id, so pending rows number 1, 2, 3... in submission order.
- SALES TREND MOCK HISTORY: added 12 historical mock orders (Oct 2025 - Sep 2026) to the dataSeed so the admin Overview Sales Trend chart renders a real multi-month line instead of a single September point; all are paymentVerified so they only feed the sales charts/KPIs, never the payment queue.
- QUEUE MOCK SEEDS RESTAGED FOR FIFO: re-staged seed order statuses so the printer is on the earliest job (ORD-0002 at 8:30 AM is Printing), while later ones (9:00, 10:00 AM) are In Queue - the "Start Here" tag now lands on the next-to-print order and the Time column reads oldest-first; normalized ORD-0004 timestamps to match when it queued.
- ORDERS HEADER CLEANED: removed the "Monitor and manage all print jobs" subtitle and the live clock/date row (and its dead timer state/imports) from the Orders page; the search/filter toolbar stays.
- SIDEBAR POLISH - BRANDED HEADER + FLAT NAV: the sidebar header (desktop + mobile drawer) now shows the Docufy logo + bold "Docufy" wordmark on the left with a PANEL-LEFT collapse toggle pinned to the right; collapsed (icon-only) shows just the centered logo (click to expand). The MAIN/OPERATIONS/MANAGEMENT gray section headings were removed, so the admin/staff navs render as one flat list; the expandable Operations/Management parents and inline children are unchanged.

## September 7, 2026 7:09 PM (PHT) - prans
- SIDEBAR COLLAPSE/EXPAND POLISH + CHECKOUT & PAYMENT REFINEMENTS (one commit): sidebar collapse/expand pass (desktop + mobile), simplified down-payment tier at checkout, customer cancellation, and landing/admin page readability updates.
- SIDEBAR COLLAPSE/EXPAND POLISH (desktop Layout + mobile nav sheet): the collapsed sidebar's Docufy logo now stays perfectly centered at the 72px width and no longer shifts during the collapse animation; hovering the collapsed logo swaps it for an expand icon, and the collapse toggle is now a PanelLeftClose arrow to match. Option labels fade/shrink when collapsing but appear instantly on expand. Press effect on nav items; the active-item select animation now replays ONLY when switching to a different main category - picking another sub-option under the SAME category no longer re-animates the parent pill. Collapsed nav-icon tooltips appear only after a 600ms deliberate hold and anchor to the sidebar's right edge so they don't drift mid-transition. The mobile nav sheet mirrors the desktop selection style (light-blue active parent pill, submenu spine, white active-child highlight bar + dot).
- CUSTOMER DOWN-PAYMENT TIER SIMPLIFIED (checkout): removed the "Pay at the Shop / Pay Online" venue chooser and the "Amount to pay today" selector for ₱50-99 orders - they now keep every payment method at checkout, and the Partial Payment (50%) vs Full Payment decision moved to the payment verification page after ordering (block replaced with a concise 50%-minimum note showing the down payment and balance on pickup). Cash on Pickup stays disabled only for the full-payment tier (₱100+).
- CUSTOMER PAYMENT VERIFICATION PAGE: added a Cancel Order action (with confirmation dialog) so customers can cancel an awaiting order directly there, plus the new Partial/Full payment amount choice for down-payment tier orders.
- LANDING PAGE: header nav now highlights the active section with a blue underline indicator; hero buttons restyled - Get Started is a solid filled-blue CTA (shadow + press effect) and the secondary button is a white/blue-outline style.
- ADMIN CONTENT MANAGEMENT: feature tiles are now editable as Title + Subtitle pairs (older saved titles auto-migrate to the new split).
- ADMIN PRICING MANAGEMENT (readability): matrix tables got darker semibold uppercase headers, tinted header rows, stronger borders, and card shadows.

## September 7, 2026 (PHT) - prans
- ORDER DETAILS MODAL OVERHAUL (staff/admin queue, presentation only): rebuilt the Order Details dialog in UnifiedOrders into a compact SaaS layout with a sticky header (title + subtitle), scrollable body, and sticky workflow-action footer (Start Printing / Mark as Completed / Release Order / Cancel Order with Enter-to-confirm). Cards reorganized as Print Job Details, Payment Summary, Additional Information, and Invoice, each with strong outer outlines (border-2 gray-300) and internal bg-gray-100 dividing lines; the Payment Summary was kept subtle (thin gray border + divider lines) with `OrderPaymentSummary` reordered (Order Total / Remaining Balance left, Amount Paid / Payment Status right) and medium-size values. Invoice action relabeled to "Download Invoice", and FileAttachments action buttons (View / Print / Download) got visible gray outlines. ConfirmationDialog texts updated for Start Printing / Completed / Released. Padding compressed throughout for a tighter read. Typecheck + build pass.
- PAYMENT DETAILS MODAL OVERHAUL (staff/admin verification, presentation only): rebuilt the Payment Details dialog in UnifiedPaymentVerification into a compact `sm:max-w-2xl` layout with a sticky header (title + subtitle + gray order badge), scrollable body, and sticky Verify/Reject footer. Customer row is a compact gray card with a circular initials avatar + submitted date/time + status badge. A lined Payment Summary block shows Order ID, Payment Type, Payment Method, and Order Total (Remaining Balance removed). A status-tinted Verification Status banner (amber/green/red) shows the badge + "Payment submitted" date/time. Payment Information (online methods only) shows the QR image (or a dashed placeholder) on the left and Account Name / Payment Number / Payment Method on the right, with no download button. The Reference Number block carries the "{method} Reference Number" header plus a compact outline "View Proof" button; all receipt / upload / notes sections were removed. Verify Payment (filled blue, left, data-primary-action) and Reject Payment (red outline, right) are the only actions in the sticky footer. ConfirmationDialogs relabeled to "Verify Payment?" / "Reject Payment?" with concise spec descriptions and "Go Back" labels.
- EARLIER-SESSION QUEUE & LOGIC REFINEMENTS (rolled in this push): below-₱50 Cash-on-Pickup orders auto-queue on placement (details dialog reads "Pending Payment -- In Queue"); the queue page gained clickable blue "Start Here" tags that open the status form for the next-to-print order; order statuses now change independently (Start Printing -> Completed -> Released, no rigid sequence-lock); payment verification keeps FIFO priority with sequence badges and "Next to Verify"; and the Inventory page got a restyled summary-card/table toolbar with pagination.

## September 8, 2026 2:04 PM (PHT) - prans
- SESSION ORDER LOCKS + LIVE CROSS-TAB ORDER SYNC (staff/admin demo for the two-PC "who's managing this order" flow): commit of the order-session-lock mechanism across both the Orders queue and Payment Verification pages, plus the shared orders snapshot that makes every staff/admin window update live without refresh.
- SESSION LOCKS (new `src/app/utils/orderLocks.ts`, wired into `UnifiedOrders.tsx` + `UnifiedPaymentVerification.tsx`): opening a details modal for an actionable order (payments: Pending/Rejected; queue: Awaiting Payment/In Queue/Printing/Completed) auto-claims a lock for that order. The holder sees a green "You are managing this order" banner and working Verify/Reject or Start Printing/Mark Completed/Release/Cancel actions; anyone else opening the same order sees an amber "{name} is managing this order" banner with those actions disabled, plus a small "X is managing" eye badge under the order id in BOTH page tables. A lock guard re-checks ownership at the FINAL confirm (in `handleVerifyPayment` and `confirmStatusUpdate`), so a second reviewer who opened the order earlier can never act once someone else holds it — they get a toast and the order's live status is re-read to avoid double-approvals.
- LOCK LIFETIME (heartbeat + owned release): the lock is RENEWED every 30s while the holder's details window stays open (heartbeat that only renews if we still hold it), so "X is managing this order" persists for exactly as long as the holder is viewing — it never vanishes mid-review. A dead tab stops beating and the lock auto-expires after 5 minutes. Releasing is OWNED: closing a modal only ever frees YOUR OWN lock (release now takes the caller's name and skips any lock held by someone else), fixing the bug where the non-holder closing their window killed the actual holder's lock. The "Start Here -> Start Printing" click-through claim also claims the lock for that order so it can't bypass the guard. Unlock-on-close and release-on-success both pass the lock-holder name.
- LIVE CROSS-TAB ORDER SYNC (`src/app/utils/dataStore.ts`): orders previously lived only in each tab's memory, so a status change in staff1's window never reached staff2/admin. Every order write (status update, verify, add, delete) now saves a shared snapshot to localStorage (`docufy_orders_sync_v1`) and every other tab adopts it via the browser `storage` event and re-notifies its subscribers — so changing "In Queue -> Printing" (or verifying a payment) in one tab updates the Orders queue, Payment Verification list, priority badges, status cards, and dashboard KPIs in OTHER open tabs INSTANTLY with no refresh. Writes first re-base on the LATEST snapshot (merge-on-write), so tabs updating different orders at the same time can't silently revert each other. Only the localStorage channel is new; the app still re-seeds the mock orders on a full page reload (existing behavior). Comments mark where Supabase (a shared `session_locks` table / order-table + Realtime) will replace both localStorage mechanisms for real multi-PC use. Typecheck + build pass.

---

## September 8, 2026 9:17 PM (PHT) - prans
- Walk-in customer type overhaul: the walk-in form now records each transaction as Walk-in Printing or Photocopy (name/email input replaced by a simple dropdown), and the queue shows a type badge on every walk-in order.
- Removed Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system-wide: stripped MFA from login, AuthContext, and all profile pages, and deleted the OTP input package.
- Implemented Walk-in Photocopy flow: selecting Photocopy skips file upload and immediately shows paper size, copies, and color mode; staff enter the price manually on review, which feeds the sales report and tracks paper stock.
- Photocopy manual price: whole-peso only (arrow keys step by 1), minimum ₱1 — still erasable and auto-defaults to ₱1 when left blank.
- Photocopy orders are never session-locked: staff/admin can manually take a photocopy anytime (locking stays for regular printing orders).
- Small mobile fixes: pages scroll to top on change and the header goes sticky with improved overflow handling.

---

## September 8, 2026 11:28 PM (PHT) - prans
- Walk-in Photocopy steps simplified to 1 & 2, attendance simplified to a single daily shift with exceeded extra clock-ins, and landing header profile chip for logged-in users (one commit).
- Implemented Photocopy walk-in flow as Steps 1 & 2 only: the walk-in Photocopy order now flows Photocopy Options (Step 1) straight to Review & Complete (Step 2) instead of jumping to the old step 4, so the step indicator reads 1-2 and the review/proceed bar renders on step 2; walk-in Printing and the customer flow still use Steps 1-4.
- Simplified staff attendance to one Time In and one Time Out per day: dropped the Morning/Afternoon session split across the timesheet, the time-in lockout gate, and the admin Attendance & Staff Monitoring view, so one continuous shift covers both AM and PM (legacy records auto-migrate).
- Implemented exceeded extra clock-ins: staff can still clock in after their day is complete - a confirmation prompt explains the day is already done and the new clock-in is logged with an amber 'Exceeded' badge in the staff Personal Time Logs, the timesheet status, and the admin attendance table (extra hours count toward total and overtime).
- Landing page header shows the profile when logged in: the header swaps its Log In button for a compact profile chip (avatar, name, and role caption) that opens the user's profile page; visitors still see Log In.

---

## September 9, 2026 4:35 PM (PHT) - prans
- Implemented Shop Status / Outage Toggle (manual, Phase A): staff/admin can mark Docufy as Paused, Open, or Closed (Scheduled) from the Dashboard, with customer-facing notice, queue hold, and payment-deadline freeze — no automated ping for now (deferred).
- Added Shop Status card to the Admin and Staff Dashboard: Mark Open / Mark Paused (reason required, optional ETA) / Mark Closed (Scheduled), with a current-status badge, reason/ETA, and who-updated-when; state persists in localStorage (docufy_shop_status_v1).
- Added a customer-facing status banner under the header on the Landing Page, Customer Dashboard, My Orders, and Order Tracking — amber "paused" with reason + ETA, gray on scheduled close.
- Gated new orders while paused: checkout disables the customer Place Order / Go to Payment Verification and the walk-in Proceed to In Queue buttons with an inline amber notice.
- Paused the queue flow: the Orders page shows a "Docufy is currently paused" banner; starting a new print (Start Printing button or the Start Here tag) is blocked unless staff overrides with a "Start Printing While Paused?" confirmation; finishing and releasing already-running jobs stays available.
- Froze payment deadlines while paused: awaiting-payment orders are no longer auto-canceled as expired during an outage and resume normally when the shop reopens.
- Added shop-status notifications: pausing alerts staff/admin and, individually, every customer with an active order (order is safe and on hold); reopening sends "Docufy is Open Again".
- Fixed Shop Status button hover legibility: Paused and Closed buttons now fill solid on hover (amber/slate with white text) instead of leaving white text on a light tint.
- Restyled Admin Job Board cards to match the customer Job Board: blue icon tile, larger bold titles, inline type/department/posted meta, applicant-count + duration footer, and a roomier gray description area.
- Updated shop operating hours to 9 AM - 6 PM (Mon-Sat, closed Sunday) across the customer-facing content defaults and the admin Content Management (saved records auto-migrate).

## September 10, 2026 1:46 AM (PHT) — prans
- Fixed the upload bug at checkout so a file right after a previous upload no longer silently fails; the input is cleared only after processing.
- Restricted allowed file formats: uploads are now PDF/DOC/DOCX/XLS/XLSX and images (JPG/JPEG/PNG/GIF/WEBP/BMP); PPT, PPTX and TXT removed, and any non-PDF selection requires a "Preferred Format: PDF" confirmation before being accepted.
- Added a per-file "Editing file" dropdown in Step 2 (replaces the small prev/next arrows), showing only the active file's print options.
- Fixed the Apply Settings to All Files hover so the text stays readable (fills dark blue, white text).
- Shortened the Step 3 add-ons note to just "Need additional supplies?".
- Landing header profile is now a dropdown menu (Go to Dashboard, Edit Profile, Sign Out with confirmation) instead of jumping straight to the profile page.
- Removed the "Your Printing Companion" subtitle from the landing header.
- Made "No noon break" more visible as a blue pill with a check icon on the landing page and Content Management preview.
- Made shop hours and location dynamic: Content Management can add/remove schedule rows and location lines plus an Hours Note, all reflected live on the landing page.
- Balanced the landing features-row spacing so the three hero blocks are evenly centered.
- Fixed the Forgot Password crash by wiring up the /forgot-password route.
- Completed the Forgot Password flow: the 6-digit code leads to the change-password screen and the new password is set via a new resetForgottenPassword (no current-password asked).
- Updated shop hours across the app to Monday-Friday 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM, Saturday and Sunday closed (constants, customer dashboard, landing defaults; saved values auto-migrate).

## September 10, 2026 5:14 PM (PHT) — prans
- Fixed the customer payment flow: an online order awaiting payment verification (held only in sessionStorage until the reference is submitted) no longer renders as an empty/unfinished Print Request — the payment page now falls back to the held order so the total, deadline, and down-payment/full-payment choice display immediately, and the amount required is derived correctly per tier so Submit Reference completes.
- Removed the duplicate "Details" line from the Order Tracking status card (it already shows in the amber Awaiting Payment banner).
- Admin UI text visibility pass: placeholders, helper text, and aria-labels across login, signup, forgot-password, notifications, orders, payment verification, inventory, staff, and attendance pages read one step darker/more legible. Public job application phone field formatted as a number.

## September 10, 2026 6:10 PM (PHT) — prans
- Landing hero logo now sits above the "printing companion" heading on mobile only (desktop layout untouched).
- Services & Pricing cards now reflect the real system catalog: Black & White and Color priced from the live pricing matrix, Binding card replaced with Photo, Vellum & Sticker (photo 2R-A4, vellum, A4 sticker sheets).
- Mobile services carousel auto-advances every 4.5s in an infinite loop and the dot indicators were removed.
- About Docufy overhauled: removed the mobile short-preview + "Show more" toggle that duplicated the same paragraph; single clean body on all screens.
- Removed the inert footer Contact link.

## September 11, 2026 12:10 AM (PHT) — aeprnts
- Unified filter toolbar UI system-wide: every admin/staff data-table page (Orders, Payment Verification, Staff) now uses the same labeled Card filter pattern as AdminAttendance — labeled fields with `text-xs font-semibold text-gray-500 uppercase tracking-wide`, blue-tinted search input with Search icon, consistent `mt-1.5` wrapper spacing, and `X` icon Clear buttons.
- Removed redundant calendar icons from native date inputs and replaced with a consistent custom CalendarDays icon (hidden native picker via CSS, added custom `absolute right-3 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2` icon) so From/To icons sit at the exact same vertical position across AdminAttendance, Orders, and Payment Verification.
- Removed the redundant "Print Request" button from the customer My Orders top action bar (sidebar nav already provides access).
- Renamed all filter "Reset" buttons to "Clear" (Payment Verification, Staff, AdminAttendance) to match the customer-side standard; switched icon from RefreshCw to X.
- Removed the redundant Orders page Reset/Clear button entirely (status resets via clickable summary cards).
- Shop Status card description text is now status-aware: Open shows accepting-orders line, Paused/Closed show reason+ETA or default status text.
- Notification dropdown: "Mark all as read" moved from footer to header row as a small blue text link; footer now only has the solid-blue "Show All Notifications" button.

## September 11, 2026 12:30 AM (PHT) — prans
- Customer payment flow fixes + no phantom canceled orders: fixed the checkout/payment experience so an order is never duplicated and never shows as Canceled before it is actually placed.
- Order Tracking single awaiting-payment card: the two "Awaiting Payment" cards were merged into one — the generic Current Status card is hidden while awaiting payment and the amber awaiting-payment card now carries a "Current Status" eyebrow with a "Payment Pending" badge.
- Duplicate-order prevention in checkout: once an order is placed, re-using the Print Request is blocked (toast "order has already been placed"), and dismissing the success dialog now fully resets the form instead of leaving a second submit path that could create a duplicate order.
- Leave-guard only when abandoning data: the "Leave print request?" prompt never fires when clicking Go to Payment Verification or re-opening a submitted order (the guard re-reads state at navigation time), and a new guard on the Payment Verification page prompts only when leaving an unsubmitted online payment (never for Cash on Pickup, after submitting, or while canceling).
- Cancel before submit reference = discard, not Canceled: canceling an online order that was never submitted now just discards the unsent request — no Canceled record is created, it never appears in My Orders/staff lists, and staff get no notification. Canceling an already-placed order still cancels normally with staff notification.
- Submitted orders are exempt from auto-expiry: submitting the payment reference clears the checkout deadline (and the expiry check skips any order with a reference), so an order awaiting staff verification is never auto-canceled as "Payment Deadline Expired" — it waits indefinitely for Verify or Reject. Cash on Pickup keeps its deadline and still auto-cancels if unpaid.

## September 11, 2026 12:55 AM (PHT) — prans
- Down payment applies only to Cash on Pickup: the 50% down payment is available only when the customer selects Cash on Pickup; choosing an online method on the same order automatically switches it to full payment (paid online), so the Partial/Full choice never appears for online payments.
- Step-4 payment messages cleaned: at checkout Step 4 the ONLY payment-requirement notice is the "Down Payment Required" card, shown only when Cash on Pickup is selected on a down-payment-tier order — the "Full Payment Required" panel and the "No down payment required" box were removed, so online and low-value orders no longer show any requirement message.

## September 11, 2026 2:13 AM (PHT) — prans
- NEW Down Payment Method page for down-payment-tier orders (₱51–99): orders in this range are no longer placed outright — checkout now holds them as pending and routes the customer to a new `/customer/payment-method/:orderId` page where they choose how to pay: **Pay at the Shop** (cash, staff verifies at the shop) or **Pay Online** (wallet), and **how much** — 50% Down Payment now (balance on pickup) or Full Amount now. Paying online also lets the customer pick the wallet there. After confirming, the choice is applied to the held order and the customer lands on Payment Verification (cash orders are materialized into the system there; online orders wait for the reference submission as before).
- "Place Order" button for down-tier customers is now "Proceed to Down Payment Method" (skips straight to the new page, no confirmation dialog); online down-tier orders route there instead of straight to payment verification, and the Step-4 online note + confirm-dialog copy were updated to mention the new confirm-payment page.
- Order Tracking while an order is awaiting staff verification now reads "Awaiting Verification" instead of always "Awaiting Payment": the heading uses the customer status label, so the am/aw card shows "Awaiting Verification" once a payment reference has been submitted and "Awaiting Payment" only when nothing has been submitted yet.
- Reverted the earlier "online = full payment only" rule: down-payment-tier orders can now pay online with the 50% down AND can still choose Full Amount, giving all four combinations (Shop+Down, Shop+Full, Online+Down, Online+Full).

## September 11, 2026 12:45 PM (PHT) — prans
- AUTO-SCALES TO ANY SCREEN/OS ZOOM: the app now automatically adapts the layout to the viewer's actual screen and Windows display scaling, so the tuned 1366px design (built and compacted for 1366×768 laptops at 100% zoom) looks identical and properly proportioned on machines that report a different CSS-pixel viewport — e.g. a PC at 125% Windows scaling renders narrower, the user's earlier complaint. Implemented via `src/app/utils/screenScale.ts`: on desktop-width viewports (≥1024px) it applies a CSS `zoom` factor on the `<html>` element equal to `realViewportWidth / 1366`, clamped between 0.6 and 1.25. Because the zoom sits on the root element it behaves like the browser's own page zoom — every Tailwind breakpoint and viewport unit re-evaluates against the virtual 1366px layout so the lg/xl layouts, full-height sidebars, and fixed-position dialogs all keep their tuned proportions on every screen. The real width is read from the Visual Viewport API (`window.visualViewport.width`), which is NOT affected by our own CSS zoom, so there is no feedback loop and the scale stays stable. Scaling is skipped below 1024px so phones/tablets keep their fully responsive mobile treatment. Wired at startup in `src/main.tsx` (calls `initScreenScale()` before render, alongside the existing internet-clock sync); resize + visualViewport listeners re-apply it live with a requestAnimationFrame debounce. No pixel values, media queries, or page code changed — this is a global runtime adapter only. Typecheck + build pass.
- WHITE BOX AT THE BOTTOM ON PAGE LOAD — FIXED: opening the site could show a blank white strip at the bottom of the screen when auto-scaling was active (the reported "white rectangle box" that only disappeared after manually zooming in/out). Root cause: a CSS `zoom` on `<html>` does NOT rescale `100vh`/`100vw` viewport units in Chromium — they keep reporting the un-zoomed window size, while percentage heights DO scale. So every full-height shell (`min-h-screen` on the page wrappers, `h-screen` on the sidebar/main column, `min-h-[100dvh]` on the Login/SignUp panels) was laid out at the *un-zoomed* viewport height and rendered visually shorter than the true window, letting the white `body` background show through at the bottom. Fix: `screenScale.ts` now publishes the correct layout-space viewport size as `--docufy-vh` / `--docufy-vw` custom properties (real viewport height/width ÷ zoom, removed when zoom = 1) on the `<html>` element, and `src/styles/index.css` adds UN-layered rules that remap `.min-h-screen`, `.min-h-[100dvh]`, `.h-screen`, `.h-svh` to `min-height/height: var(--docufy-vh, 100vh)` (the notification dropdown's `max-h-[min(32rem,calc(100vh-6rem))]` / width cap now use `var(--docufy-vh/vw, …)` too). Un-layered rules beat Tailwind's layered utilities, so the override always wins; when zoom is inactive the variables are unset and behavior falls back to plain `100vh` (identical to before). Verified: measured in headless Chromium that `100vh` = un-zoomed innerHeight while `100%` = innerHeight/zoom, duplicated the shells in a replica to confirm the remap makes them fill exactly one window (e.g. zoom 0.781 → 667px layout = 521px visual), and pixel-checked the real built app — landing/login/signup bottom rows are page-colored at both zoom-out (1024px) and zoom-in (1536px) sizes, no white strip. Typecheck + build pass.
- NOTIFICATIONS NOW LIVE WITHOUT RELOADING (same-tab + cross-tab): new notifications and announcements appear instantly on the "See all notifications" page and drive the header bell badge without a page refresh — including when the notification is created in ANOTHER browser tab/window. `notificationStore` and `announcementsStore` gained a `storage` event listener that watches the shared localStorage key and reloads the store from storage whenever another tab writes to it (then notifies all in-memory subscribers, which is what re-renders the Notifications page and the bell). Both stores were refactored to a clean read/reload/save split (`parseNotifications`, guarded `loadFromStorage`, unconditional `reloadFromStorage`/`reload`, `saveToStorage`) so the storage-handler path bypasses the one-time `initialized` guard and always refreshes. Same-tab already worked via the existing in-memory `subscribe`; this commit closes the cross-tab gap so staff/admin notifications sent from another window (order placed, paused shop, low stock, etc.) show up immediately with no refresh. Typecheck + build pass.

## September 11, 2026 1:19 PM (PHT) — prans
- My Orders statuses now match staff/admin: the customer My Orders list and status badges now display the exact same active status set as the staff/admin Orders page (Awaiting Payment / In Queue / Printing / Completed / Released / Canceled). The customer-only "Awaiting Verification" special label was removed from the My Orders badges — a payment with a submitted reference now simply reads "Awaiting Payment" in My Orders, identical to the staff view — while Order Tracking and the customer Dashboard keep their friendlier "Awaiting Verification" / "Ready for Pickup" / "Picked Up" wording. The My Orders filter dropdown already used the shared status set, so only the badge text changed. Typecheck + build pass.
- Auto-scale no longer fights the browser's own zoom (fixes the zoom-out-then-zoom-in blur): the auto-scale factor was previously computed from the Visual Viewport width, which CHANGES when the user zooms the browser (Ctrl +/- / trackpad pinch). Measuring that meant our CSS zoom also re-ran on every browser-zoom step — so zooming out made the app re-zoom itself (the page visibly zoomed in/out) and every compensation step re-rasterized text at a different fractional scale, leaving it blurry. `screenScale.ts` now reads the screen's CSS-pixel width (`screen.availWidth`/`screen.width`), which always reflects the OS display scaling (e.g. 125% Windows = 1536) but NEVER changes with the browser's page zoom — so our CSS zoom stays fixed at the OS-scaling factor and the user's own browser zoom simply works on top, crisply, with no oscillation. The 1024px desktop gate, the 0.6–1.25 clamp, and the --docufy-vh/--docufy-vw remap are unchanged; the viewport-height variables still track the live window so full-height shells keep filling the screen at any browser zoom. Typecheck + build pass.

- Locked the customer Print Request while the shop is paused/closed: previously only the final Place Order button was disabled with a tiny inline note, so customers could still walk through upload/options and hit the dead button at Step 4. Now, when the shop is marked Paused or on Scheduled Close (the admin Shop Status toggle), the whole customer print-request form is replaced by a lock screen — an amber (paused) or gray (scheduled close) icon with "Docufy is currently paused" / "Docufy is on scheduled close", the admin-stored reason + estimated return when provided, a "New print requests can't be placed right now — existing orders are safe and will resume once we reopen." note (mirrors the shared ShopStatusBanner), and a Back to Dashboard button. It reacts live when the toggle flips. Walk-in mode was already gated at the submit button and is unchanged.
- Down payment now applies ONLY to Cash on Pickup: the 50%-down function (the "Down Payment Method" page) appears only when the customer selects Cash on Pickup. Choosing an online method on a down-payment-tier order (₱50–99) now routes straight to payment verification and must be paid in FULL online — the order is created as a normal online full payment (`fullPaymentRequired`, no down step). Checkout flags, the "Proceed to Down Payment Method" button, the Step-4 online note, the place-order confirm dialog, and the success modal were all cleaned to the plain online wording for online payments. The Down Payment Method page itself is now cash-only (a static "Pay at the Shop" card instead of the Pay Online venue choice and wallet picker) while keeping the 50%-down vs full-amount choice; online down-tier orders carry the full-payment flags so staff/admin verification and the customer payment page treat them like any online full payment. Cash down-tier keeps exactly the same Partial (50%) / Full flow as before. Typecheck + build pass.

## September 11, 2026 5:58 PM (PHT) — prans
- Fixed staff/admin order total mismatch: the amount shown on the staff/admin Orders list was sometimes lower than what the customer actually submitted (e.g. a ₱6 order displaying as ₱3). Customer and walk-in orders were being created WITHOUT a cost breakdown, so the Orders list fell back to a flat per-page estimate instead of the pricing the customer was charged. New orders now save their exact cost breakdown (per-file printing cost + add-ons + total) so the staff/admin list, order details, and invoices always match the customer's submitted total.
- Per-tab login sessions (prototype): the logged-in user is now remembered in that tab's own browser session instead of shared browser storage, so one tab can stay logged in as a customer while a different tab is logged in as staff/admin. Refreshing a tab no longer replaces its user with whoever is logged in on another tab.

---

## September 11, 2026 6:50 PM (PHT) — prans
- Re-enabled online down payments for down-payment-tier orders (₱50–99): customers on these orders can again pay the 50% down payment with an online method (GCash/Maya) instead of being forced to pay the full amount online. The Partial (50%) / Full choice now happens on the customer Payment Verification page — the customer picks whether to pay just the 50% down now or the full total, and the order is saved with the matching down/full-payment flags. The balance from a down payment is still collected in cash at pickup.
- Down-payment status shown on customer Order Tracking: orders with a down payment now show a dedicated "Down Payment Verified / Awaiting Down Payment" status with the amount paid and the balance due on pickup, instead of falling into the generic verified/pending wording.
- Staff/admin views reflect online down payments automatically: the Payment Verification list shows them as "Down Payment" (Total / Paid / Balance), verifying one puts the order in the queue with the balance still due, and the order details show Partially Paid with the balance collected at pickup.
- Down Payment Method page threshold fix: the cash down-payment page used hardcoded ₱51–99 bounds for its own tier check while the rest of the app used the admin-configurable pricing store — it now reads the real down/full-payment thresholds, so changed thresholds stay consistent across the whole flow. Typecheck + build pass.

---

## September 11, 2026 8:10 PM (PHT) — prans
- Down Payment Method page redesigned around a "Pay at the Shop / Pay Online" choice: EVERY down-payment-tier order (₱50–99), cash AND online, now lands on the Down Payment Method page after checkout (previously online down-tier went straight to Payment Verification). "Pay at the Shop" materializes the held order and sends the customer straight to order tracking (NO customer Payment Verification step) — the order stays On Hold until staff/admin verifies at the counter. "Pay Online" shows the wallet picker (live payment-methods store, defaulting to the method chosen at checkout), keeps the 50%/Full amount choice, then proceeds to Payment Verification for the usual receipt upload. The venue defaults from the checkout method (Cash → shop, online wallet → Pay Online).
- At-shop verification with a 50%/Full choice for staff/admin: a cash order in the down-payment range paid at the shop is now detected in Payment Verification (new cash "down-tier" state) and shown with a "₱X down · ₱Y on pickup" amount line. The details dialog asks "how much was paid at the shop?" with Paid 50% Down / Paid Full Amount buttons (defaulting to the customer's plan). Verifying as 50% keeps the down-payment flags and partial-payment balance (collected on pickup) while queuing the order; verifying as Full rewrites it to a fully-paid order (full-payment flags, no balance due).
- Order Tracking down-payment wording is now payment-method-aware: cash at-shop down payments read "paid in cash at the shop" / "pay in cash at the shop before your order can be printed", online ones keep the "paid via {method}" wording.
- Customer checkout buttons/labels updated so ALL down-tier orders say "Proceed to Down Payment Method" and the Step-4 online note explains the two-step flow (choose how to pay on the Down Payment Method page, then upload the receipt on Payment Verification). Typecheck + build pass.

## September 11, 2026 8:50 PM (PHT) — prans
- Fixed "Awaiting Verification" displaying as "Awaiting Payment" in the customer My Orders list: the status badge now uses `getCustomerStatusLabel(order)` so orders with a submitted payment reference correctly show "Awaiting Verification" (amber) instead of the raw status "Awaiting Payment". Order Tracking status pill removed as it was a redundant duplicate of the already-shown Current Status heading text (both the amber awaiting banner and the generic banner). Current Status card fonts bumped up one step across both banners for better visibility — status headings now `text-2xl`, body text `text-base`, and box text `text-sm`. Typecheck + build pass.

## September 11, 2026 9:36 PM (PHT) — prans
- Added pagination to the staff/admin Payment Verification and Orders lists: both tables now show 10 rows per page with Previous/Next and page-number buttons plus a "Showing X–Y of N" count, and the list resets to page 1 whenever a filter/search/date change. Added 20 new mock orders to the seed data (mixed-status demo rows and batches of pending and In-Queue/Printing orders) so both pages actually have more than one page to flip through.
- Kept all five Payment Verification summary cards always visible (Pending Verification, Verified Today, In Queue, Cancelled / Expired, Total Verified Today) — the earlier "only show when filtered" hiding was reverted at the user's request.
- Fixed the Status / Type / Method filter dropdowns on Payment Verification opening at the far right edge of the screen instead of under their buttons: the app's auto-scale applies a CSS `zoom` on `<html>`, which broke Radix Select's portal positioning math. Those three selects were replaced with a lightweight custom dropdown rendered with plain CSS absolute positioning (same technique as the header notification/profile menus), so the list always opens directly under its own button at any zoom level. Also wrapped the toolbar's Clear button so it can no longer overlap the Method dropdown when the sidebar is open. Typecheck + build pass.

## September 11, 2026 10:13 PM (PHT) — prans
- Landing page Job Openings now live from the jobs store: the openings list subscribes to the jobsStore so postings added/archived by the admin appear immediately without reloading, and each opening card was aligned with the Job Board treatment (type badge, Posted date, Department).
- Removed the seeded "Customer Service Representative (Walk-in)" job: the opening was only demo data, so it was taken out of the seed jobs and the seed version was bumped to re-seed existing browsers (the admin can still add it back on the Job Board management page).
- Job Application page redesigned for mobile: the apply form was rebuilt as a clean, mobile-first flow with clear sections (Personal Information → Position & Application → Resume → Terms & Conditions), larger touch-target inputs, inline per-field validation on blur (so the customer can see what's missing before submitting), a clearer Resume field (a "Paste Link / Upload File" choice with helper text and a compact file card after upload), a full-width filled-blue Submit Application button with a submitting/spinner state, and a compact info note instead of the bulky card.
- Job Application success state: after the application is saved, the form is replaced by a dedicated confirmation screen — a check icon, "Application Submitted", the real Application ID returned by the store, the review timeframe, a "View Application Status" button (to the Job Board applications tab), and "Back to Dashboard". The Submit button never reappears after a successful submission.
- Customer Profile Settings redesigned for mobile: the profile page now opens in a clean read-only view (identity card with avatar/name, Personal Information && Account Security list cards) and switches to an edit form only when Edit Profile is tapped — fields show as tidy labels/values instead of disabled inputs, the avatar camera upload lives in edit mode, and Save keeps the confirmation dialog then returns to the view.
- Mobile back buttons made consistent across customer pages: the Notifications page back button was reworked from a full-width bar to the same compact "← Back" control every other customer page uses, and the mobile back button was added to the Print Transaction page (customer mode).
- Dashboard Overview heading hidden for the staff role: the Overview title/subtitle no longer renders on the staff dashboard since staff get no tab bar — the greeting and date-range selector stay. My Orders page mobile back button aligned to the same compact "← Back" pattern. Typecheck + build pass.

## September 11, 2026 10:20 PM (PHT) — prans
- Made the Order Details / Payment Details popups fit the screen at the app's auto-scale: under the CSS `zoom` the app applies on `<html>`, Chromium keeps `vh` at the un-zoomed window size, so the `max-h-[92vh]` cap let the staff/admin Order Details (and Payment Details) dialogs overflow the visible area. Both dialogs now use the same `--docufy-vh` viewport-height remap as the full-height shells (`max-h-[calc(var(--docufy-vh,100vh)*0.92)]`), so the popup always stays inside the window at any zoom/display scale.
- Verifying a low-value cash payment no longer resets the order back to In Queue: cash-on-pickup orders under the down-payment threshold (auto-queued at checkout) could already be printing by the time staff verified the payment, but verification always forced the status back to "In Queue". Verifying these orders now leaves the current status untouched (retains In Queue / Printing), while every other order still moves to the queue on verification.
- Fixed new Order IDs not matching the seed format: the order counter's parse regex was extracting the YEAR from IDs like ORD-2026-0046, so the next order became "ORD-2027" and new orders never matched the `ORD-2026-XXXX` numbering shown in the staff/admin list. The counter now properly separates the year and the sequence number, generates IDs in the exact `ORD-YYYY-NNNN` format (so ORD-2026-0047 comes after ORD-2026-0046), and is re-initialized from the existing orders on load. Typecheck + build pass.

- Mobile button hierarchy enforced across customer UI: every primary action is now a solid filled-blue button (`bg-[#1D73EC]` or `bg-[#2F6FD6]`) so the dominant action is always visually prominent, and secondary/destructive actions sit clearly below or beside it. Payment Verification online footer stacks Submit Reference (solid blue) above Cancel Order (red outline); cash footer stacks Track Order (solid blue) above Dashboard; success dialog "See My Order" is solid blue. Job Board "Apply for this Position" changed from outline to solid filled blue. Walk-in photocopy review moved "Proceed to In Queue" above the Back/Cancel row, and the walk-in action group container uses `flex-col-reverse` so the primary sits on top on mobile while desktop side-by-side (Cancel left, Proceed right) is preserved.
- Mobile back button consistency: customer Payment Verification mobile back arrow now uses the standard compact "← Back" pattern; AdminProfile and StaffProfile desktop "Back" buttons hidden `md:inline-flex` so mobile uses the Layout header back arrow exclusively.
- Red asterisks on all required form labels: asterisks switched from gray to `text-red-500` across OrderTracking (Reason for Cancellation), ShopStatusControl (Reason), PaymentMethodsManagement (3 fields), Staff add/edit dialogs (9 fields), JobBoardManagement (8 fields), and PaymentVerification (Reference Number, Proof of Payment upload).
- Proof-of-payment upload now required on the customer Payment Verification page: handleSubmit validates `proofFile` is present before allowing submission, and the upload label shows a red asterisk. Typecheck + build pass.

- Fixed staff sidebar hierarchy: "Clock-In & Timesheet" is now a direct top-level staff nav item (right after Inventory) instead of living under a "Operations" parent menu — the OPERATIONS group was removed from the staff sidebar and from the walk-in/staff page menus, so the staff nav is flat and shorter.

## September 12, 2026 2:42 AM (PHT) — prans
- Mobile-first Sign Up page redesign: the account form now stacks in a single clean column on phones (name/email/phone and password fields go full-width), with a full-width filled-blue "Create Account" button and a centered Docufy logo + "Back to Home" link on top; desktop keeps the two-column layout with the white outline button. Added a 600ms submitting state (spinner + "Creating Account...", double-submit guard), larger touch targets, red `text-red-500` asterisks, autocomplete/enterKeyHint hints, and accessible show/hide password buttons.
- Consistent search box sizing across filter toolbars: the search input on the Orders page, Payment Verification, Staff, AdminAttendance, and customer My Orders now use the same `w-full sm:max-w-xs` responsive width (full-width on mobile, fixed-width on desktop) instead of stretching/overlapping.
- Staff dashboard Overview header alignment: the date-range selector now right-aligns under the staff greeting (`sm:ml-auto`) so the header row reads correctly now that the Overview title is hidden for staff.
- Orders summary cards moved above the filter bar: on the staff/admin Orders page the six status summary cards now render directly under the page heading with the search/filter toolbar below them, so the cards stay visible without scrolling.
- Invalid-date guards added: `toPHT` and the Orders time-period helper now return gracefully instead of crashing (RangeError) if fed a bad/invalid stored date, so the Order Details page can never blow up on corrupted persisted data. Typecheck + build pass.
- Streamlined the staff Clock-In page: the big timer widget is now a compact "Current Shift" card with a single filled-blue Time In/Time Out button and simplified Clocked In / Clocked Out status (the Shift Complete/Exceeded header pills, the amber "Time In Again (Extra)" state, and the Back to Dashboard link were removed — extra clock-ins after the day is done are still recorded and still marked Exceeded on the log rows). The three metrics cards now read Today / This Week / Overtime this week, and the collapsed history lists recent entries as compact Today/Yesterday rows instead of a one-line today summary. Typecheck + build pass.

- Zoom-broken dropdowns now open under their button everywhere: the app's auto-scale applies a CSS `zoom` on `<html>`, which makes Radix Select's portaled list mis-position (it flies away from its trigger instead of opening below it). Every remaining Radix Select was replaced with the anchored, zoom-safe dropdown — Customer Type + all print-flow option selects (photocopy Paper Size / Color Mode, photo size, doc Paper Size, Page Range, Color Mode, Editing-file picker, mobile Quick Templates) in the walk-in/customer print request, the Inventory Reports All Categories / All Items filters, the Job Application Resume "Paste Link / Upload File" choice, and the Staff / Admin Attendance / Orders / Notifications filter selects. The shared `ZoomSafeDropdown` renders a plain absolutely-positioned list directly under the button (outside-click + Escape close) with no portal, so it stays put at any zoom/display scale. Out-of-stock paper sizes are now greased out and unselectable in the dropdown instead of being clickable.
- Completed the half-converted print-request file (was left non-compiling): added the missing ZoomSafeDropdown import, removed a stray JS comment that had broken the photocopy Color Mode JSX, and replaced a mis-bound Paper Size dropdown that pointed at the wrong field with dangling Select children left behind. Typecheck + build pass.

- Removed the empty white space below the landing-page footer: a decorative blurred circle reached 192px past the page wrapper and, because the wrapper only clipped horizontal overflow, that blank area became scrollable under the Terms/Privacy/logo/copyright row. The wrapper now clips vertically too, so the page ends exactly at the footer. Typecheck + build pass.

- Shop Status / Announcements broadcasts are now sent to customers only: the admin "Create Announcement" (renamed from "Create Notification") and shop-status change notifications (Paused / Open Again / Scheduled Close) no longer notify staff/admin - they target only customer accounts. Customers are a ll notified individually per signed-in email, while notifications pushed to staff/admin by their own actions were dropped from the broadcast path.
- Admin Dashboard Overview no longer carries the sales cards: the Sales Trend and Sales Comparison cards were removed from the Overview tab, so the merged Sales tab (/admin overview tab) owns all sales analytics - the Overview now shows just the KPI row plus the Inventory Snapshot and Recent Transactions cards.
- Sales tab reorganized: Sales Trend (wide, 2/3) and a new Today's Sales card (compact, 1/3) now sit on the same row via a 3-column grid instead of Sales Trend stretching full width.
- Inventory Snapshot card bottom space filled without growing the card: a compact "Current Stock Levels" per-item list now fills whichever leftover vertical space remains under the three stock tiles (aligned by the same row height as Recent Transactions), while the card itself keeps its original height. Papers-left and stock-value figures were kept out of the healthy-warehouse notice; the total stock value stays in the low-stock state as before.
- Recent Transactions now shows the most recent 6 orders (was 4) and stretches its rows to fill the card with a footer showing "Showing N recent" plus the total ₱ of those orders.
- Payment Verification summary cards are informational again: only the Pending Verification card keeps its click behavior (Pending/All toggle), while Verified Today, In Queue, Cancelled / Expired, and Total Verified Today revert to plain read-only stats - filtering stays with the Status/Type/Method dropdowns to avoid clicking one card clearing another.
- Payment Verification "#" priority badge unified with the Orders page: both tables now use the same shared PriorityBadge component (solid blue circle, ring on the "Next to Verify" row) instead of Payment Verification's older lighter inline badge. Typecheck + build pass.

- Admin and staff sidebars are grouped back under the MAIN / OPERATIONS / MANAGEMENT section headings so the navigation structure is scannable at a glance: each uppercase heading labels its group of items (Dashboard/Orders/Payment Verification/Walk-in/Inventory under MAIN, Operations and Management as expandable parents) in both the desktop sidebar and the mobile drawer. The heading is non-interactive and only shows when labels are visible, so the collapsed icon-only sidebar and the flat customer menu stay unchanged.
- Negative confirmation modals now clearly signal risk in red and grey across the system. The shared confirmation dialog (used for Cancel Order, Reject Payment, Remove Payment Method, Delete, Reset, Sign Out) shows a red accent border, a red warning icon, a red "cannot be undone" warning box and a solid red confirm button, while the safe cancel button stays neutral grey - so users pause before triggering irreversible actions. Positive confirmations (Place Order, Time In, Restore, Save) keep their normal blue look. The walk-in Cancel Transaction prompt was also switched from amber to the same red/grey risk styling. Typecheck + build pass.

- Refined the Payment Details modal action footer: Reject Payment (white/red outline, secondary) sits in the bottom-left corner and Verify Payment (solid Docufy blue, primary) in the bottom-right of a dedicated compact footer, separated from the scrollable payment info by a thin top divider. Buttons were slimmed to standard modal size with a quieter hover (no more large lift/shadow), and on mobile the two actions stack full width with Verify Payment first then Reject Payment. Payment summary, reference, View Proof, session lock, and confirm dialogs are unchanged. Typecheck + build pass.
